        "abstract": "on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying through the atmosphere . the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonic speeds is the subject of theoretical treatment .  the times required for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes) to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gas particle, are important in determining the observable effects of hypersonic trails-i.e., emitted thermal radiation and reflection of electromagnetic waves from the trail . in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is divided into two regions ..  (1) the expansion-controlled trail, which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail, where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the high-temperature core . the influence of the details of the body shape on the observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based on integral methods .  results of calculations that assume thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density distribution .  it is shown that the cooling of the conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that viscous effects are not important .  it is found that this portion of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream .  flight velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft .",

        "abstract": "a mixing theory for the interaction between dissipative flows and nearly isentropic streams . by means of a simplified theoretical /model,/ the present paper treats the general class of flow problems characterized by the interaction between a viscous or dissipative flow near the surface of a solid body, or in its wake, and an /outer/ nearly isentropic stream .  for the present, the external flow is taken to be a plane, steady, supersonic flow, which makes a small angle with a plane surface or plane of symmetry, although the methods used can be extended to curved surfaces, to axially symmetric supersonic flows, and also to subsonic flows .  the internal dissipative flow is regarded as quasi-one-dimensional and parallel to the surface on the average, with a properly defined mean velocity and mean temperature .  the nonuniformity of the actual velocity distribution is taken into account only approximately by means of a relation between mean temperature and mean velocity . mixing, or the transport of momentum from outer stream to dissipative flow, is considered to be the fundamental physical process determining the pressure rise that can be supported by the flow . with the aid of this concept, a large number of flow problems is shown to be basically similar, such as boundary-layer shockwave interaction, wake flow behind blunt-based bodies (base pressure problem), flow separation in overexpanded supersonic nozzles, separation on wings and bodies, etc .",

(1) by the action of air forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct transmission of unbalanced forces from the power plant through the engine mounting .  the latter has always caused the preponderance of disturbance . vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the associated parts, and always shorten the useful life of the entire aircraft structure .  more important, however, are the psychological and physiological effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise on the passengers and crew .  this may very likely be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so intimately associated with flying .  the importance and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can hardly be questioned . this paper is limited to a consideration of the directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body of relatively large mass .  it is also limited to the case of engines and engine supporting structures having axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods employed could easily be extended to other cases .",

(a) thermodynamic equilibrium, in which the chemical reaction rates are regarded as /very fast/ compared to the rates of diffusion across streamlines., (b) diffusion as rate-governing, in which the volume recombination rates within the boundary layer are /very slow/ compared to diffusion across streamlines .  in either case the gas density near the surface of a blunt-nosed body is much higher than the density just outside the boundary layer, and the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles are much less sensitive to pressure gradient than in the more familiar case of moderate temperature differences .  in fact, in case (a), the nondimensionalized enthalpy gradient at the surface is represented very accurately by the /classical/ zero pressure gradient value, and the surface heat-transfer rate distribution is obtained directly in terms of the surface pressure distribution .  in order to illustrate the method, this solution is applied to the special cases of an unyawed hemisphere and an unyawed, blunt cone capped by a spherical segment . in the opposite limiting case where diffusion is rate-controlling the diffusion equation for each species is reduced to the same form as the low-speed energy equation, except that the prandtl number is replaced by the schmidt number .  the simplifications introduced in case (a) are also applicable here, and the expression for surface heat transfer rate is similar., the maximum value of the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by diffusion alone and by heat conduction alone in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium is given by..  (prandtl no./schmidt no .) when the diffusion coefficient is estimated by taking a reasonable value of atom-molecule collision cross section this ratio is 1.30 . additional theoretical and (especially) experimental studies are clearly required before these simple results are accepted .",

        "abstract": "dynamics of a dissociating gas . this is a lucid introduction to the effects of dissociation in gas dynamics .  the problem in view is that of air flow past a bluff body at speeds somewhat above 2 km sec . thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed,. theories of near equilibrium for transport properties and of large departures from equilibrium being promised in parts 2 and 3 . following a survey of the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of a pure dissociating diatomic gas, a new model is introduced .  this /ideal dissociating gas/ is characterized by only three constants, the characteristic temperature, density and internal energy for dissociation . physically, it may be regarded as having its vibrational modes always just half excited (so that at low temperatures the ratio of specific heats approaches 4 3 rather then 7 5) .  thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas are derived, and the oblique shock wave relations deduced in the /strong-shock/ approximation (including an elegant relation between the principal curvatures of any bow shock and the subsequent vorticity) .  useful relations are given for the isentropic changes that take place along streamlines between shocks . various of these results are applied to the problem typified by a sphere flying at high mach number .  the newtonian impact theory and its empirical modification are dismissed as lacking theoretical basis, in favor of the limit for large values of both mach number and density ratio across the shock .  it is suggested that the zero surface pressure sometimes predicted by the latter theory corresponds to separation not of the flow but of the shock wave from the surface .  an estimate is given for the subsequent shape of the shock .  finally, another approximation is applied to the region near the stagnation streamline .  the fluid is assumed incompressible, but rotational in accord with the shock relations,. and it is shown that a spherical shock corresponds to a concentric spherical body . the resulting surface pressure is within 1 per cent of that predicted by freeman's second approximation based on the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (same j. 1 (1956),",

        "abstract": "the downstream influence of mass transfer at the nose of a slender cone . the influence of localized mass transfer at the nose of a slender cone under hypersonic flow conditions has been studied by experimental and theoretical means .  two gaseous coolants, nitrogen and helium, are injected through a porous plug subtending a half angle of 30 .  the effect of the mass transfer on the shock shape, pressure distribution, heat transfer, and transition are investigated .  the experimental work involved tests in the mach-number-8.0 tunnel at pibal .  the theoretical analysis involved a study of the effect of mass transfer on the shock stand-off distance and leads to an inviscid-flow parameter permitting the experimentally determined shock shape and pressure distribution to be extrapolated to other than test conditions and to other coolant gases .  there is obtained the maximum value of this parameter resulting in no significant alteration of the pressure distribution on the cone and thus defining the flows in which boundary-layer-type similarity applies . significant reductions in heat transfer are obtained with injection .  indeed, with small amounts of helium injection the peak heating is found to occur downstream on the cone and to be an order of magnitude less than would occur at the stagnation point without mass transfer .  with nitrogen early transition is found to occur, so that local heating rates are actually increased over those prevailing at the same reynolds number without injection .",

        "abstract": "the calculation of wall shearing stress from heat-transfer measurements in compressible flows . it has been shown by ludwieg that the wall shearing stress of a laminar or turbulent boundary layer in an incompressible flow can be determined from a heat-transfer measurement at the surface .  the instrument used in that investigation was essentially a small, locally insulated, heating element embedded in the test surface .  the size of the instrument was restricted by the condition that the thermal boundary layer generated by the heating element be contained locally within the laminar sublayer .  in the present analysis ludweig's theory for such an instrument is extended to compressible flow over an insulated flat plate . with the same limitations on the design and operation of the instrument as mentioned above, it can also be assumed for compressible laminar and turbulent boundary layers that only the flow in the immediate vicinity of the wall or the laminar sublayer will be affected in the region of the heated element .  this assumption then permits the use of the laminar boundary-layer equations as the governing equations for this analysis for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers .",

(where air intakes are concerned, it is assumed that they are sharp-edged and that there is no /spillage/ of the internal flow) . the following conclusions apply to the former class of bodies .  the variation of drag with mach number is found to depend only on the discontinuities in the longitudinal rate of change of the cross-sectional area, and is thus independent of cross-sectional shape . the drag itself is unchanged if the direction of the flow is reversed .  the expressions for lift and moment assume the same forms as for smooth pointed bodies, the lift depending only on conditions at the base of the body . the general theory is applied to winged bodies of revolution with an unswept wing leading edge ..  the results bear a marked resemblance to those obtained by ward .  the results for wings alone are seen to be applicable, with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds .",

        "abstract": "an analysis of the corridor and guidance requirements for supercircular entry planetary atmospheres . an analysis is presented of supercircular entry into a planet's atmosphere giving particular attention to the corridor through which spacecraft must be guided in order to accomplish various maneuvers . a dimensionless parameter based on conditions at the conic perigee altitude is introduced for characterizing supercircular entries and conveniently prescribing corridor widths associated with elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic approach trajectories .  the analysis applies to vehicles of arbitrary weight, shape, and size .  illustrative calculations are made for venus, earth, mars, jupiter, and titan . for nonlifting vehicles having fixed aerodynamic coefficients, curves are presented of dimensionless parameters from which can be calculated the maximum deceleration, maximum rate of laminar convective heating, and total laminar heat absorbed during single-pass entry at velocities up to twice circular velocity .  for lifting vehicles, curves are presented of the maximum deceleration and overshoot boundary of an entry corridor,. equations are presented for estimating laminar aerodynamic heating from the maximum deceleration .  it is shown that the corridor width is independent of vehicle weight, dimensions, and drag coefficient, provided these are the same at the overshoot boundary as at undershoot .  the corridors of certain planets can be broadened markedly by the application of aerodynamic lift,. for example, the 10-earth-g corridor width for single-pass, nonlifting, parabolic entry is increased from to 52, 51, and 52 miles, respectively, by employing a lift-drag ratio of 1 .  the use of aerodynamic lift does not increase appreciably the corridors of mars and titan .  all corridor widths decrease rapidly as the entry velocity is increased . terminal guidance requirements on accuracy of velocity and flight path angle for successfully entering various corridors are compared with analogous requirements for putting a satellite into orbit, for hitting the moon from the earth, and for achieving icbm accuracy .  consideration is given to the terminal guidance problem involved in using a planet's atmosphere--rather than rocket fuel--to effect orbital transfers from heliocentric to planeto-centric motion, thereby converting a hyperbolic approach trajectory to an elliptic orbit about the target planet .  this fuel saving maneuver appears technologically feasible for certain planetary voyages, and implies the possibility of achieving a large reduction in required earth lift-off weight of chemical propulsion systems .",

        "abstract": "the effect of a central jet on the base pressure of a cylindrical afterbody in a supersonic stream . this report describes an experimental investigation of the factors affecting the base flow and jet structure behind a cylindrical after-body with a central nozzle . seven interchangeable nozzles were tested . six of these were convergent-divergent, with a design mach number of 2.0, jet base diameter ratios ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 and nozzle divergence angles ranging from convergent with a jet base diameter ratio of 0.6 . in the main experimental programme the free-stream mach number was 2.0 and the boundary layer was turbulent both on the after-body and in the nozzle . measurements were made of the base pressure, the surface pressure distribution inside the nozzle, the overall thrust and the nozzle mass flow, over a range of jet pressures . this programme was supplemented by comparative tests with the jet exhausting into still air (static tests) . readings were taken of the internal nozzle pressures and the jet thrust at different jet pressures .  schlieren photography was used extensively throughout . the results of the tests with external flow are presented in the form of curves showing the separate effects of jet pressure ratio, jet base diameter ratio, nozzle design mach number and nozzle divergence angle on the base pressure and overall thrust .  the special case of base bleed is discussed separately .  similar curves are included for the static tests .  these show the effect of jet pressure ratio and nozzle geometry on the jet thrust . a general method of correlating data on annular base pressures is proposed and discussed .  essentially, this method compares the pressure on an annular base with the calculated pressure on the corresponding two-dimensional base .  it correlates the present results reasonably well, but is less successful when applied to more extensive data .",

        "abstract": "base pressure in supersonic flow . the problem of accurately predicting the pressure and wake configuration at the base of bodies in supersonic flow is an extremely important one inasmuch as a sizeable portion of the total drag of a given body may be attributable to the low pressure in this region .  although a great deal of theoretical and experimental work has been done in this field, there does not yet exist a satisfactory method for accurate predictions . this paper represents an excellent effort to experimentally confirm analytically deduced concepts .  a large amount of experimental data on body shapes such as wedges, cones, and cone-cylinders has been obtained over a range of mach numbers up to 4 . the data are thoroughly discussed with respect to analytical deductions .  on the basis of the evidence accumulated it is concluded that the boundary-layer thickness has only a small effect on the base pressure for axisymmetric bodies and for two-dimensional bodies when the base height-to-chord ratios are of the order . reviewer believes this report is a significant contribution in the field of base pressure and wake flow phenomena .",

        "abstract": "investigation of separated flows in supersonic and subsonic streams with emphasis on the effect of transition . experimental and theoretical research has been conducted on flow separation associated with steps, bases, compression corners, curved surfaces, shock-wave boundary-layer reflections, and configurations producing leading-edge separation . results were obtained from pressure-distribution measurements, shadow-graph observations, high-speed motion pictures, and oil-film optics . the maximum scope of measurement encompassed mach numbers between 0.4 and 3.6, and length reynolds numbers between 4000 and 5000000 . the principal variable controlling pressure distribution in the separated flows was found to be the location of transition relative to the reattachment and separation positions . classification is made of each separated flow into one of three regimes .. and /turbulent/ with transition upstream of separation . by this means of classificaiton it is possible to state rather literal results regarding the steadiness of flow and the influence of reynolds number within each regime . for certain pure laminar separations a theory for calculating dead-air pressure is advanced which agrees well with subsonic and supersonic experiments . this theory involves no empirical information and provides an explanation of why transition location relative to reattachment is important . a simple analysis of the equations for interaction of boundary-layer and external flow near either laminar or turbulent separation indicates the pressure rise to vary as the square root of the wall shear stress at the beginning of interaction . various experiments substantiate tnis variation for most test conditions . an incidental observation is that the stability of a separated laminar mixing layer increases markedly with an increase in mach number . the possible significance of this observation is discussed .",

        "abstract": "a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic speeds . steady flow about curved airfoils at high supersonic speeds is investigated analyticially . with the assumption that air behaves as a diatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansion method may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up to extremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflection angles are not too close to those corresponding to shock detachment . this result applies not only to the determination of the surface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of the whole flow field about an airfoil . verification of this observation is obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics by extensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wave curvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressure distribution on a 10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angle of attack . an approximation to the shock-expansion method for thin airfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is found to yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at mach numbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25 . this slender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus may prove useful for some engineering purposes . effects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbed flow fields at  high mach numbers are investigated, particular attention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specific heats . so long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably below to include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantially as accurate as for ideal-gas flows . this observation is verfied with the aid of a generalized shock-expansion method and a generalized method of characteristics employed in forms applicable for local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankine . the slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an average value of the ratio of specific heats for a particular flow field . this simplified method has essentially the same accuracy for imperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flows . an approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high mach numbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats may approach close to 1 . in this case, it is found that the shock-expansion method may be in considerable error,. however, the busemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream mach number and specific-heat ratio of 1 appears to apply with reasonable accuracy .",

        "abstract": "propeller in yaw . it was realized as early as 1909 that a propeller in yaw develops a side force like that of a fin .  in 1917, r. g. harris expressed this force in terms of the torque coefficient for the unyawed propeller .  of several attempts to express the side force directly in terms of the shape of the blades, however, none has been completely satisfactory .  an analysis that incorporates induction effects not adequately covered in previous work and that gives good agreement with experiment over a wide range of operating conditions is presented herein .  the present analysis shows that the fin analogy may be extended to the form of the side-force expression and that the effective fin area may be taken as the projected side area of the propeller .  the effective aspect ratio is of the order of 8 and the appropriate dynamic pressure is roughly that at the propeller disk as augmented by the inflow .  the variation of the inflow velocity, for a fixed-pitch propeller, accounts for most of the variation of side force with advance-diameter ratio v nd . the propeller forces due to an angular velocity of pitch are also analyzed and are shown to be very small for the pitching velocities that may actually be realized in maneuvers, with the exception of the spin . further conclusions are ..  a dual-rotating propeller in yaw develops up to one-third more side force than a single-rotating propeller .  a yawed single-rotating propeller experiences a pitching moment in addition to the side force .  the pitching moment is of the order of the moment produced by a force equal to the side force, acting at the end of a lever arm equal to the propeller radius .  this cross-coupling between pitch and yaw is small but possibly not negligible . the formulas for propellers in yaw derived herein (with the exception of the compressibility correction) and a series of charts of the side-force derivative calculated therefrom have been presented without derivation in an earlier report .",

        "abstract": "theory and tunnel tests of rotor blade for supersonic turbines . in special circumstances where a large work output is required from a turbine in a single stage it is necessary to use high pressure ratios across the nozzle blades, thus producing supersonic velocities at inlet to the rotor .  as part of an investigation into such turbines, several designs for the inter-blade passages of the rotor have been tested in a two-dimensional tunnel, a design theory being developed concurrently . the first design, featuring constant passage width and curvature as in steam-turbine practice, but having thin leading and trailing edges, was found to suffer from focusing of the compression waves from the concave surface, with consequent flow separation from the opposite convex surface .  it gave a velocity coefficient of measured at an inlet mach number of 1.90 and turning angle of 140 deg .  the measured value compares favourably with values from previous steam tests, where the results have been in the range from 0.65 to 0.92 . from theoretical reasoning, and from additional test observations, a subsequent passage was designed having an inlet transition length of small curvature, leading to a free-vortex passage of double the transition curvature,. a small amount of contraction was incorporated . schlieren photographs showed the flow in this passage to be almost shock free .  a thin region of low-energy air existed close to the convex surface, but liquid-injection tests located only one small bubble of reversed flow . pressure traverses at exit indicated a velocity coefficient of 0.952, based on the area-mean total pressure . when allowance is made for turning angle and reynolds number this result appears to compare quite favourably with previous work . it would seem that the optimum blade pitching in a turbine would be about 20 to 30 per cent closer than in a two-dimensional cascade .  however, the resultant pitching tends to become very close, except at very large turning angles, with the result that in some applications difficulties could arise in the practical design and manufacture . several uncertainties remain and the present design must be regarded as still experimental .",

        "abstract": "the supersonic axial flow compressor . an investigation has been made to explore the possibilities of axial-flow compressors operating with supersonic velocities into the blade rows .  preliminary calculations showed that very high pressure ratios across a stage, together with somewhat increased mass flows, were apparently possible with compressors which decelerated air through the speed of sound in their blading .  the first phase of this investigation, which has been reported in naca acr l5d20, was the development of efficient supersonic diffusers to decelerate air through the speed of sound . the present report is largely a general discussion of some of the essential aerodynamics of single-stage supersonic axial-flow compressors .  in the supersonic flow about isolated bodies, large energy losses usually occur due to wave systems which extend far from the bodies .  supersonic flow entering a cascade is considered and, in this case, the possibility of entirely eliminating this extended wave system is demonstrated,. thus, no reason for supersonic compressors to be necessarily inefficient is apparent .  the conditions that occur as the flow through the compressor is being started are discussed and a hypothesis as to the type of transonic flow which will be encountered is proposed . as an approach to the study of supersonic compressors, three possible velocity diagrams are discussed briefly .  because of the encouraging results of this study, an experimental single-stage supersonic compressor has been constructed and tested in freon-12 .  in this compressor, air decelerates through the speed of sound in the rotor blading and enters the stators at subsonic speeds .  a pressure ratio of about 1.8 at an efficiency of about 80 percent has been obtained .",

(1) near the nozzle (distances less than 4 or 5 jet diam downstream of the nozzle) the intensity of turbulence, expressed as percent of core velocity, is a maximum at a distance of approximately increasing mach and or reynolds number .  at distances greater than 8 jet diameters downstream of the nozzle, however, the maximum intensity moves out and decreases in magnitude until the turbulence-intensity profiles are quite flat and approaching similarity .  (2) the lateral and longitudinal scales of turbulence are nearly independent of mach and or reynolds number and in the mixing zone near the jet vary proportionally with distance from the jet nozzle .  (3) farther downstream of the jet the longitudinal scale reaches a maximum and then decreases approximately linearly with distance .  (4) near the nozzle the lateral scale is much smaller than the longitudinal and does not vary with distance from the centerline, while the longitudinal scale is a maximum at a distance from the centerline of about mum moves out from the centerline .  (6) a statistical analysis of the correlograms and spectra yields a /scale/ which, although different in magnitude from the conventional, varies similarly to the ordinary scale and is easier to evaluate .",

        "abstract": "on the strength distribution of noise sources along a jet . the spatial distribution of noise sources along a jet is investigated by application of lighthill's theory to regions of 'similar' profiles .  the analysis refers to the noise power emitted by a 'slice' of jet (section between two adjacent planes normal to the axis) as a function of distance x of the slice from the nozzle . it is found that this power is essentially constant with x in the initial mixing region (x law), then further downstream (say 8 or 10 diameters from the nozzle) falls off extremely fast (x law or faster) in the fully developed jet .  because of this striking attenuation of strength with distance, it is concluded that the mixing region produces the bulk of the noise and must dominate in muffler behavior,. conversely, the 'fat' part of the jet must contribute much less to the total noise power than is commonly supposed . powell's experiments on the effects of nozzle velocity profile on total noise power are interpreted qualitatively .  the behavior of multiple-nozzle or corrugated mufflers, both as to overall quieting and frequency-shifting, is also interpreted in the light of the results .  the possibility emerges that such mufflers may be improved without serious thrust loss by the addition of a sound-attenuating shroud .",

        "abstract": "elliptic cones alone and with wings at supersonic speeds . to help fill the gap in the knowledge of aerodynamics of shapes intermediate between bodies of revolution and flat triangular wings, force and moment characteristics for elliptic cones have been experimentally determined for mach numbers of 1.97 and sectional axis ratios from 1 through 6 and with lengths and base areas equal to circular cones of fineness ratios 3.67 and 5 have been studied for angles of bank of 0 and 90 . elliptic and circular cones in combination with triangular wings of aspect ratios 1 and 1.5 also have been considered .  the angle-of-attack range was from 0 to about 16, and the reynolds number was 8x10, based on model length .  in addition to the forces and moments at angle of attack, pressure distributions for elliptic cones at zero angle of attack have been determined . the results of this investigation indicate that there are distinct aerodynamic advantages to the use of elliptic cones .  with their major cross-sectional axes horizontal, they develop greater lift and have higher lift-drag ratios than circular cones of the same fineness ratio and volume . in combination with triangular wings of low aspect ratio, they also develop higher lift-drag ratios than circular cones with the same wings .  for winged elliptic cones, this increase in lift-drag ratio results both from lower zero-lift drag and drag due to lift .  visual-flow studies indicate that, because of better streamlining in the crossflow plane, vortex flow is inhibited more for an elliptic cone with major axis in the plane of the wing than for a circular cone with the same wing .  as a result, vortex drag resulting from lift is reduced . shifts in center of pressure with changes in angle of attack and mach number are small and about the same as for circular cones . comparisons of theoretical and experimental force and moment characteristics for elliptic cones indicate that simple linearized (flat plate) wing theory is generally adequate even for relatively thick cones . zero-lift pressure distributions and drag can be computed using van dyke's second-order slender-body theory . for winged circular cones, a modification of the slender-body theory of naca rep. 962 results in good agreement of theory with experiment .",

        "abstract": "an improved smoke generator for use in the visualisation of airflow, particularly boundary layer flow at high reynolds numbers . and rapid method by which boundary layer flow was rendered visible has been previously described in the journal of the royal aeronautical society .  it gave promise of being useful at the highest tunnel speeds provided a denser smoke could be obtained, which at the same time was free from the troublesome deposits associated with the wood smoke . of the aerodynamics division attempts were made by the fuel research station to improve the density of the wood smoke and to reduce the deposits .  these they showed were conflicting requirements, and whilst some improvement was effected, it was not sufficient for observation in the new tunnels at high speeds . the staff of the director-general of scientific research and development, ministry of supply, was then approached and it was decided to develop an oil smoke generator from a simple generator of this type which was demonstrated to us .  this has been done successfully . the final apparatus in contrast to the wood smoke generator is light and compact .  it takes only a few minutes to start and can be run as long as desired . improvement on the wood smoke both as regards density and freedom from deposits, which cause premature transition .  the density and quality of the smoke are now under control .  smokes ranging from a light smoke of bluish white colour to a heavy smoke dense white in appearance can be obtained .  the oil smoke retains the advantages of the wood smoke in that it is non-corrosive and non-irritant, and the smell can be tolerated even when it is present in a considerable concentration .  a certain amount of condensation is inevitable with oil smokes, but with suitable precautions troubles arising from this can be avoided .  a dry solid smoke made by melting a hard wax was successfully generated with the same apparatus .  unfortunately because of its flocculent nature this smoke gave rise to solid deposits when passed through bore tubing, leading eventually to complete blockage .  this seems to be a feature of solid smokes . the apparatus has been used to determine transition and laminar separation points on model wings in a number of the national physical laboratory tunnels .  smoke filaments have been maintained in the laminar state up to wind speeds of 180 ft. sec. in the new tunnels . there is much to be said for making a standard practice of visualising boundary layer flow on models, particularly as the technique is simple and rapid .  it would greatly assist the interpretation of force measurements and the more detailed explorations of the boundary layer by total head tubes and hot wires . the use of oil smoke is not limited to boundary layer flow visualisation .  the apparatus described in this report would seem to be particularly suited for educational work in small demonstration tunnels .",

(including a factor of 2 for ground reflection) is taken as an upper limit for the acceptable strength of the bow wave from such an aircraft it is shown that restrictions on the climb and flight plan will be involved .  the advantage of the employment of larger engines with or without afterburning is discussed, with reference also to the penalties involved owing to the increase in weight of the aircraft and its direct operating costs . finally it is suggested that an aircraft of given volume could be designed, by suitable choice of thickness and lift distribution, to minimise the strength of the shock waves in the far field .",

        "abstract": "an approximate solution of the turbulent boundary layer equations in incompressible and compressible . if over the 'outer region' of the boundary layer, where the mean velocity varies but little from its value outside the shear layer, a virtual eddy viscosity is defined, which is constant over the outer region but varies in the direction of the mainstream, a solution of the turbulent boundary layer equations can be found which satisfies the appropriate boundary conditions .  the solution leads to a compatibility condition for the virtual eddy viscosity in terms of the wall shear stress, the boundary layer momentum thickness and the mainstream velocity, at least for the case of a constant external velocity .  this compatibility condition, which can be expressed as for moderate to high reynolds numbers, where is the shear velocity, is the boundary layer thickness and is the virtual eddy (kinematic) viscosity, is just the condition townsend (1956) found for the equilibrium of the large eddies .  the numerical value of the constant derived by townsend agrees with ours for reynolds numbers (based on x) of about .  with this relation for an equation, analoguous to the momentum integral equation solution, can be found for as a function of local freestream velocity, with one disposable parameter .",

        "abstract": "the formation of a blast wave by a very intense explosion . this paper was written early in 1941 and circulated to the civil defence research committee of the ministry of home security in june of that year .  the present writer had been told that it might be possible to produce a bomb in which a very large amount of energy would be released by nuclear fission--the name atomic bomb had not then been used--and the work here described represents his first attempt to form an idea of what mechanical effects might be expected if such an explosion could occur . in the then common explosive bomb mechanical effects were produced by the sudden generation of a large amount of gas at a high temperature in a confined space .  the practical question which required an answer was ..  would similar effects be produced if energy could be released in a highly concentrated form unaccompanied by the generation of gas .qm  this paper has now been declassified, and though it has been superseded by more complete calculations, it seems appropriate to publish it as it was first written, without alteration, except for the omission of a few lines, the addition of this summary, and a comparison with some more recent experimental work, so that the writings of later workers in this field may be appreciated . an ideal problem is here discussed .  a finite amount of energy is suddenly released in an infinitely concentrated form .  the motion and pressure of the surrounding air is calculated .  it is found that a spherical shock wave is propagated outwards whose radius r is related to the time t since the explosion started by the equation where is the atmospheric density, e is the energy released and s a calculated function of, the ratio of the specific heats of air . the effect of the explosion is to force most of the air within the shock front into a thin shell just inside that front .  as the front expands, the maximum pressure decreases till, at about 10 atm., the analysis ceases to be accurate .  at 20 atm. 45 of the energy has been degraded into heat which is not available for doing work and used up in expanding against atmospheric pressure . this leads to the prediction that an atomic bomb would be only half as efficient, as a blast-producer, as a high explosive releasing the same amount of energy . in the ideal problem the maximum pressure is proportional to r, and comparison with the measured pressures near high explosives, in the range of radii where the two might be expected to be comparable, shows that these conclusions are borne out by experiment .",

        "abstract": "several magnetohydrodynamic free-convection solutions . the influence of transverse magnetic fields on the laminar free-convection flow of liquid metals over a vertical flat plate and between vertical parallel plates is examined for specific wall temperature variations and prandtl numbers .  the extent of influence on the flow and temperature fields is determined by the magnitude of a nondimensional influence parameter which is the ratio of the magnetic force to the buoyant force .  in general, increasing the magnetic field strength decreases the magnitude of the velocity, wall shear, and surfaces heat transfer and increases the temperature throughout the fluid . analytical results demonstrate that magnetic fields of practical strengths exert considerable influence on liquid metal free-convection flow fields .",

        "abstract": "oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory . the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for conducting boundary-layer transition experiments .  the use of the shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles . boundary-layer transition investigations have been made on optically polished pyrex hemisphere-cylinder and ellipse-cylinder models with stagnation-to-wall enthalpy ratios between 4.5 and roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms) . transition was detected by measurements of the heat-transfer rates on the model surface . the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere .  this implies that transition first occurred in the sonic region .  the transition reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 .  transition occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemisphere-cylinder model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio increased from about 9.5 to 29.5 . the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical portion of the shock tube hemisphere-cylinder model provided an extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled hemisphere-cone-cylinder model in a wind tunnel .  the transition reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition reynolds numbers obtained in the wind-tunnel experiments .  the results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundary-layer cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation- to-wall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30 .  that is, the transition reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary- layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000 based on local external properties and a distance along the body surface from the stagnation point) . the boundary-layer history (body shape history) appeared to be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the transition reynolds number with increased boundary-layer cooling .  that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds number on the ellipse-cylinder configuration than on the hemisphere-cylinder .  also, the increase in transition reynolds number with an increase in boundary-layer cooling was even less significant for the ellipse-cylinder than the hemisphere-cylinder .",

(1) a relatively simple turbulent theory which is based on recent theoretical work and which takes into account the upstream history of the boundary layer, and (2) the flat-plate reference-enthalpy theory, which depends on only /local/ conditions .  although both theories are in reasonable agreement with the data, the latter method is simpler and somewhat more accurate . for transitional flow the theory mentioned first can be readily modified in order to permit reasonable estimates of transitional heat transfer to be obtained .  on this basis it is possible to estimate laminar, transitional, and fully developed turbulent heat transfer under hypersonic blunt-body conditions . the behavior of transition reynolds number based on momentum thickness is also discussed and shown to be in quantitative agreement with recent shock-tube measurements .",

(1) laminar free convection--i.e., flows which take place due to a body force--and (2) laminar forced convection . for free convection on vertical plates, similar solutions are obtained for two different power-law surface temperature variations, and it is shown that one of these solutions constitutes a new type of boundary problem .  results of numerical integrations of the equations are compared with solutions of the similar boundary-layer equations for free convection, and it is demonstrated that a range of surface temperature variations exists for which the boundary layer equations are no longer valid . for forced convection, it is shown that the use of similarity transformations provides an alternate method of deriving the ordinary differential equations for some well-known solutions, such as couette and stagnation point flows .  solutions are obtained for radial converging or diverging flows between plane surfaces when the temperatures of the surfaces vary as arbitrary powers of the distance from the orgin .  results of numerical integrations of the ordinary differential equations are presented for prandtl numbers of 0.01 and 1.0 and for linear surface temperature variations .  some rather surprising results are obtained for diverging flows when separation occurs and some revealing comparisons with results from boundary-layer theory are made .",

        "abstract": "scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments . the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds arise from differences between the conditions under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in how they behave after separation .  for turbulent boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly as the reynolds number is changed and in many examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed artificially .  the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by excrescences attached to the surface .  the fact that the effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever possible . several methods which can be used to fix transition are described, and the results obtained by using them are compared . in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement is found, and explanations can be advanced for cases in which discrepancies occur .  several uncertainties and difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed and illustrated by examples .  in particular, special care is needed in interpreting the results obtained with transition fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10 based on local chord for wings of about 0.1 thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner wings) . the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may separate from very close to the leading edge .  under these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice . more research is needed before sound recommendations can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully . in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples are given of the spurious results that have been avoided successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead of the shock, and of the conditions under which there are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition have been satisfactory .",

        "abstract": "the boundary layer near the stagnation point in hypersonic flow past a sphere . flow properties behind shock waves caused by bluff bodies traveling at supersonic speeds are of major importance in missile and high-speed aircraft design .  paper presents a mathematical solution for the laminar boundary layer near the stagnation point of a sphere .  surface temperature is free-stream static and shock is strong .  air is assumed calorically and thermally perfect with a prandtl number of 0.72 and a dynamic viscosity directly proportional to temperature . based on work of homann (zamm 16, p. 153, 1936) and lighthill simultaneous differential equations for the velocity and temperature profiles .  these are solved by numerical integration along a normal to the surface using a digital computer .  results are presented as functions of free-stream mach number, reynolds number, and specific heat ratio .  as increases, boundary-layer thickness is shown to decrease while shock stand-off distance increases .  stand-off distance also decreases with increasing and decreasing specific heat .  for constant and specific heat ratio, the product of skin-friction coefficient and the square root of decreases with increasing only approaching a constant value at greater than 10,000 . reviewer's comment is concerned with the perfect gas assumption for air .  author suggests that the effects of dissociation on flow properties are accounted for by a proper choice of specific heat ratio .  a consideration of the kinetics of chemical reaction in the cooled boundary layer emphasizes the oversimplification of this approach .  the effect on transport properties could have been approximated in present analysis by changing the prandtl number to one more representative of the existing pressures and temperatures .",

        "abstract": "various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied gas flow . this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply . results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of continuum theory .  based on theoretical and experimental evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition .  this model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities . in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes of problems ..  a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/ class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction . for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer are small at the shock wave boundary .  here, the use of the navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given by the hugoniot relations is justified .  for the merged layer class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditions .  a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/ conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis .  in this case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses, and heat conduction . for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for both the viscous and merged layer class of problems .  solutions of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region .  to illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful approximation at hypersonic speeds .  to illustrate the merged layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere using the incipient merged layer approximation . results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear, and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled sphere flying at hypersonic speed .  with decreasing reynolds number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime . as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease . calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy . for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the same quantities are presented as for the sphere .  the increase found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction theory . a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and the behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations . qualitative agreement is indicated .",

        "abstract": "influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer at hypersonic speeds . in order to bring out the importance of the leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds, the influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of steady flow over a semi-infinite, insulated flat plate..  (1) sharp leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal shock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly curved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature, and the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wave larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory, and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the framework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave influence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the blunt leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this parameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of the leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical and experimental study .",

        "abstract": "the analytical design of an axially symmetric laval nozzle for a parallel and uniform jet . the equations for the nozzle's contours are derived by integration of the characteristic equations of the axially symmetric flow . since it is not possible to integrate these equations mathematically in an exact form, it was necessary to find a way to approximate the calculations .  the approximation offers itself by considering and comparing the conditions of the flow in a cone with those in a nozzle, as a linearization of the characteristic equations . the first part of the report deals with equations for the transition curve by which the conical source flow is converted into a parallel stream of uniform velocity .  the equations are derived by integration along a mach line of the flow in the region where the conversion takes place .  a factor f is introduced expressing a relation between the direction and the velocity of the flow along a certain mach line .  f remains undetermined and is not involved in the final equations . in the second part of the report, the spherical sonic flow section is converted into a plane circular section of the throat . the nozzle's contour adjacent to the throat is formed by the arc of a circle connected with the transition curve by a straight line . the gas dynamic properties of the boundary mach line are calculated in table 1, the use of which shortens the calculations considerably .",

        "abstract": "an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter in real fluids . it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curve slope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flow theory, even at small angles of attack .  as the stall angle is approached, the lift curve slope continually decreases and thus deviates even more from the theoretical value .  pinkerton employed the measured circulation to determine the pressure distribution and found that the resulting prediction of the moment is considerably improved over that given by the classical theory . this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowski condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the flow pattern .  practically, this is accomplished by giving a fictitious camber to the profile .  since potential flow theory is valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layer thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate source distributions .  the boundary layer cannot be evaluated, of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is applied .  a criterion to determine the circulation, by generalizing the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by preston and spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edge shall have the same value when determined from the potential-flow values above and below the airfoil .  this procedure gives qualitative information concerning viscous effects in steady flow .",

        "abstract": "a method for analysing the insulating properties of the laminar compressible boundary layer . in some cooling problems associated with high energy flows it may be convenient to localize strongly the cooling, as for example by injecting a coolant through an upstream porous strip, and to depend on the insulating properties of the boundary layer to reduce, or to eliminate completely the need for further cooling on the surface downstream of the highly cooled section .  this upstream cooling technique may be of interest in connection with optical windows in hypersonic wind tunnels, and on radomes, wings, and bodies of high-speed aircraft and missiles . in this paper a method for investigating the insulating properties of a laminar compressible boundary layer on a two- dimensional surface with zero heat transfer is presented .  the physical situation considered thus corresponds to the case in which the heat transfer downstream of the strongly cooled section is completely eliminated .  of practical concern is how the temperature of the uncooled surface varies in the downstream direction from its low initial value and thus how the low energy layer established by the upstream cooling insulates the downstream surface . the karman integral method extended to both the momentum and energy partial differential equations of the boundary layer has been used .  the station, at which cooling and or injection ceases, corresponds to a discontinuity in boundary conditions and thus in solutions .  at this point the flux of mass, momentum, and energy within the boundary layer has been made continuous by the introduction of three additional parameters in the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles .  thus the velocity and stagnation enthalpy profiles have both been taken as sixth degree polynomials .  the resulting two integral-differential equations are then solved for two unknown functions of the distance along the wall .  these two functions are related to the boundary-layer thickness and to the wall temperature .  initial conditions corresponding to a given initial wall temperature and an initial boundary-layer thickness are prescribed .  exact closed-form solutions for the case of zero axial pressure gradient are obtained .  for flows with significant pressure gradients, numerical solutions are required in general .  several numerical examples of practical interest are presented .",

        "abstract": "the generalized expansion method and its application to bodies travelling at high supersonic airspeeds . it is demonstrated that the shock-expansion method can be generalized to treat a large class of hypersonic flows, only one of which is flow about airfoils .  this generalized method predicts the whole flow field, including shock-wave curvatures and resulting vorticity, providing that (1) disturbances originating on the surface of an object are largely absorbed in shock waves with which they interact and (2) disturbances associated with the divergence of stream lines in tangent planes to the surface are of secondary importance compared to those associated with the curvature of stream lines in planes normal to the surface .  it is shown that these conditions may be met in three-dimensional as well as two-dimensional hypersonic flows .  when they are met, surface streamlines may be taken as geodesics, which, in turn, may be related to the geometry of the surface . the validity of the generalized shock-expansion method for three-dimensional hypersonic flows is checked by comparing predictions of theory with experiment for the surface pressures and bow shock waves of bodies of revolution .  the bodies treated are two ogives having fineness ratios of 3 and 5 .  tests were conducted at mach numbers from 2.7 to 6.3 and angles of attack up to 15 degrees in the 10- by 14-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the ames aeronautical laboratory .  at the lower angles of attack, theory and experiment approach agreement when the ratio of mach number to fineness ratio--that is, the hypersonic similarity parameter--exceeds 1 .  at the larger angles of attack, theory tends to break down, as would be expected, on the leeward sides of the bodies . as a final point, it is inquired if the two-dimensionality of inviscid hypersonic flows has any counterpart in hypersonic boundary-layer flows .  the question is answered in the affirmative, and results of experiment are employed to provide a partial check of this conclusion .",

(for parts 1 and 2, cf. the same quart. 3, 117-142, 218-234 (1945),. these rev. 7,225,226 .) the stability character of a viscous fluid is considered in detail .  the author proceeds first to give a proof of a criterion of stability due to heisenberg ..  if a velocity profile has an number and phase velocity, the disturbance with the same wave number is unstable in the real fluid when the reynolds number is sufficiently large .  this destabilizing effect of viscosity is one of the most interesting phenomena in the general stability theory,. its physical and mathematical significance is carefully discussed . the author then discusses the behavior of the so-called neutral curve for the two characteristic types of velocity distribution, the boundary layer type profile and the symmetrical profile .  the asymptotic behavior of the neutral curve is discussed first .  the main difference between profiles with and without a point of inflection is that the two branches of the neutral curve approach and for profiles with a flex, but both converge to for the profile without a flex .  the most important results are as follows . for sufficiently large reynolds number r .  (2) there always exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable .  a similar result was obtained by synge from energy considerations .  synge found a limiting curve below which the motion is necessarily stable .  the author's discussion of the asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers .  hence the qualitative shape of the curve is determined . the author proceeds to show that simple approximate expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his general analysis for a given velocity profile .  these approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 .  the reynolds numbers are based on the width of the channel and the displacement thickness, respectively .  finally, the method for computing the complete instability curve is presented and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked out in detail .  the stability limit for blasius flow had been given before by tollmien and schlichting .  the present more exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned . the value found here is r=420 .  the neutral curve for poiseuille motion had not been obtained before .  the minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 .  the agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion mentioned above is thus very good . a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous effects and of future developments concludes the paper .",

        "abstract": "an experimental investigation of the flow over blunt-nosed cones at a mach number of 5. 8. shock shapes were observed and static pressures were measured on spherically-blunted cones at a nominal mach number of 5.8 over a range of reynolds numbers per inch from 97,000 to 238,000, for angles of yaw from 0 to 8 .  six combinations of the bluntness ratios 0.4, 0.8, and 1.064 with the cone half angles 10, 20, and 40 were used in determining the significant parameters governing pressure distribution . the pressure distribution on the spherical nose for both yawed and unyawed bodies is predicted quite accurately by the modified newtonian theory given by, where is the angle between the normal to a surface element and the flow direction ahead of the bow shock .  cone half angle was found to be the significant parameter in determining the pressure distribution near the nose-cone junction and over the conical afterbody .  on the 40 spherical nosed cone models the flow overexpanded with respect to the taylor-maccoll pressure in the region of the spherical-conical juncture, after which the pressure returned rapidly to the taylor-maccoll value .  for models with smaller cone angles the region of minimum pressure occurred farther back on the conical portion of the model, and the taylor-maccoll pressure was approached more gradually .  the shape of the pressure distributions as described in nondimensional coordinates was independent of the radius of the spherical nose and of the reynolds number over the range of reynolds number per inch between .97 x 10 and 2.38 x 10 . integrated results for the pressure foredrag of the models at zero yaw compared very closely with the predictions of the modified newtonian approximation, except for models with large cone angles and small nose radii, where the drag approaches the value given by the taylor-maccoll theory for sharp cones .",

        "abstract": "evaluation of high angle-of-attack aerodynamic derivative data and stall-flutter prediction techniques . the problem of stall flutter is approached in two ways .  first, using the m.i.t.-naca airfoil oscillator, the aerodynamic reactions on wings oscillating harmonically in pitch and translation in the stall range have been measured, evaluated, and correlated where possible with available published data, with the purpose of providing empirical information where no aerodynamic theory exists .  the major effects of reynolds number, airfoil shape, and reduced frequency on the aerodynamic reactions have been reaffirmed .  no instances of negative damping were observed in pure translatory motion and the ranges of negative damping occurring in pure pitch had the same general trends noted by other experimenters .  data on the time-average values in the stall range of both lift and moment are presented for the first time . second, the results of numerous experimental observations of stall flutter have been reviewed and the various known attempts at its prediction have been examined, compared, and extended .  the sharp drop in critical speed and change to a predominantly torsional oscillation usually associated with the transition from classical to stall flutter is apparently primarily but not entirely caused by the marked changes in moment due to pitch .  fairly good stall-flutter predictions have been reported only when adequate empirical data for this aerodynamic reaction happened to be available for the desired airfoil shape, reynolds number range, and reduced-frequency range .  a semiempirical method of predicting the variations of moment in pitch with airfoil shape, reduced frequency, initial angle of attack, and amplitude of oscillation has been presented .",

        "abstract": "several approximate analyses of the bending of a rectangular cantilever plate by uniform normal pressure . three methods of approximating the deflections and moments occurring in a rectangular cantilever plate subjected to uniform normal pressure over its entire surface are presented in this paper .  the first is the application of the well-known finite-difference procedure .  the second and third are collocation methods, one based upon polynomial solutions of the lagrange equation, the other employing /mixed/ hyperbolic-trigonometric terms satisfying this equation .  in the last two methods the boundary conditions are satisfied exactly along the clamped edge and at a finite number of points along the free edges of the plate . the results obtained for the particular case of a cantilever plate with uniform normal load indicate that the use of a relatively small number of points in the collocation method yields values of deflections and moments that are in substantial agreement with those given by the finite-difference procedure .  it cannot be concluded from these results that the collocation method using the assumed functions will give satisfactory results with fewer points than the finite-difference method for cantilever plates with loading different from the one investigated .",

        "abstract": "thin airfoil theory based on approximate solution of the transonic flow equation . the present paper describes a method for the approximate solution of the nonlinear equations of transonic small disturbance theory . although the solutions are nonlinear, the analysis is sufficiently simple that results are obtained in closed analytic form for a large and significant class of nonlifting airfoils . application to two-dimensional flows with free-stream mach number near 1 leads, for instance, to general expressions for the determination of the pressure distribution on an airfoil of specified geometry and for the shape of an airfoil having a prescribed pressure distribution and gives, furthermore, the correct variation of pressure with mach number at mach number 1 . for flows that are subsonic everywhere, the method yields a pressure-correction formula that is more accurate than the prandtl-glauert rule and compares favorably with existing higher approximations . for flows that are supersonic everywhere, the method yields the equivalent, in transonic approximation, of simple wave theory . results obtained by application of these general expressions are shown to correspond closely to existing solutions and to experimental data for a wide variety of airfoils .",

(a) the material of the projectile ,. (b) the ambient gas in the range ,. and (c) the pressure in the range .  three optical techniques were used to observe the wake radiation .. which show a turbulent viscous wake as the pressure in the range is decreased from one atmosphere to about 20 cm hg . which show the luminous flow field at pressures between 30 and ence of short luminous streaks, which disappear suddenly as the pressure is decreased below 3 cm hg for air, and below 0.8 cm hg for argon . both air and argon, which show the main features of the flow field .  above the transition pressure, the intensity of radiation from the wake is always associated with fluctuations that appear to be the same phenomenon as the drum-camera streaks . the appearance of the streaks in the drum camera and photo-multiplier data is interpreted as transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the viscous wake, because experimental evidence shows that their appearance is not controlled by chemical, radiative, or ablative processes, but depends on aerodynamic effects .  this conclusion is supported by other experiments based on optical and schlieren techniques .  the transition in the wake at positions very close to the body is given by a local reynolds number of 10 for air, and 3 x 10 for argon .  the results indicate a possible local-mach-number effect .",

(these assumptions may be compared with the empirical relations suggested by cope .) it is shown that a transformation of the ordinate normal to the layer can lead to a simplified form of equation of motion very similar to the ordinary incompressible equation but modified by a multiplicative factor g in the pressure term .  this factor is greater than unity at the boundary and tends to one at the outside of the layer . several particular solutions are considered including accelerated flow with a linearly increasing velocity and retarded flow along a flat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity . the general implications of the theory are discussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn when the mainstream velocity starts from a stagnation point, rises to a maximum and subsequently falls .  it is concluded that for such a velocity distribution increasing compressibility will reduce the skin friction, increase the boundary layer thickness and cause earlier separation as compared with the incompressible flow with the same mainstream velocity distribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding to conditions at the stagnation point .",

        "abstract": "the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer . after an extensive survey of mean-velocity profile measurements in various two-dimensional incompressible turbulent boundary-layer flows, it is proposed to represent the profile by a linear combination of two universal functions .  one is the well-known law of the wall .  the other, called the law of the wake, is characterized by the profile at a point of separation or reattachment . these functions are considered to be established empirically, by a study of the mean-velocity profile, without reference to any hypothetical mechanism of turbulence .  using the resulting complete analytic representation for the mean-velocity field, the shearing-stress field for several flows is computed from the boundary-layer equations and compared with experimental data . the development of a turbulent boundary layer is ultimately interpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedly represents the large-eddy structure and is a consequence of the constraint provided by inertia .  this equivalent wake profile is modified by the presence of a wall, at which a further constraint is provided by viscosity .  the wall constraint, although it penetrates the entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flow and in the logarithmic profile near the wall . finally, it is suggested that yawed or three-dimensional flows may be usefully represented by the same two universal functions, considered as vector rather than scalar quantities .  if the wall component is defined to be in the direction of the surface shearing stress, then the wake component, at least in the few cases studied, is found to be very nearly parallel to the gradient of the pressure .",

        "abstract": "atomic recombination in a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle . the flow of an ideal dissociating gas through a nearly conical nozzle is considered . the equations of one-dimensional motion are solved numerically assuming a simple rate equation together with a number of different values for the rate constant . these calculations suggest that deviations from chemical equilibrium will occur in the nozzle if the rate constant lies within a very wide range of values, and that, once such a deviation has begun, the gas will very rapidly 'freeze' . the dissociation fraction will then remain almost constant if the flow is expanded further, or even if it passes through a constant area section . an approximate method of solution, making use of this property of sudden 'freezing' of the flow, has been developed and applied to the problem of estimating the deviations from equilibrium under a wide range of conditions . if all the assumptions made in this paper are accepted, then lack of chemical equilibrium may be expected in the working sections of hypersonic wind tunnels and shock tubes . the shape of an optimum nozzle is derived in order to minimize this departure from equilibrium . it is shown that, while the test section conditions are greatly affected by 'freezing', the flow behind a normal shock wave is only changed slightly . the heat transfer rate and drag of a blunt body are estimated to be reduced by only about 25 per cent even if complete freezing occurs . however, the shock wave shape is shown to be rather more sensitive to departures from equilibrium .",

        "abstract": "compressor operation with one or more blade rows stalled . an analysis of the part-speed operating problems of high-pressure-ratio ratio multistage axial-flow compressors was made by means of a simplified stage-stacking study .  the principal problems considered were poor low-speed efficiency, multiple-valued performance characteristics at intermediate speeds, and poor intermediate-speed compressor surge or stall-limit characteristics . the analysis indicated that all these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance characteristics of the front stages . such discontinuities can be due to the type of stage stall or to a deterioration of stage performance resulting from stall of adjacent stages . the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor part-speed operation were also considered . this phase of the study indicated that such compromises would severly reduce the complete-compressor-stall margin . furthermore, the low-speed stage stall problem is transferred from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible to abrupt-stall characteristics . the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to part-speed compressor performance . these characteristics must, however, be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of the multistage compressor . alleviation of part-speed operation problems may also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or stage- loading margin . the results of this analysis are only qualitative . the trends obtained, however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental studies of high-pressure-ratio multistage axial-flow compressors, and the results are valuable in developing an understanding of the off-design problem . in addition to these stage-matching studies, a general discussion of variable-geometry features such as air bleed and adjustable blades is included .",

        "abstract": "the equilibrium piston technique for gun tunnel operation . a modified technique for the operation of a gun tunnel is suggested based on experimental results .  if the piston mass and the initial barrel pressure are chosen correctly, then the peak pressures associated with the gun tunnel may be eliminated .  under these conditions the piston is brought to rest with no overswing .  some measurements of the piston motion using a microwave technique are reported which confirm this idea . the wave diagram associated with this mode of operation is shown, and some calculations of the stagnation pressure are given which show that during the suggested running time, the stagnation pressure may be considerably greater than the driving pressure if the driving chamber cross-sectional area is large compared with that of the driven section .  for a uniform shock tube the stagnation pressure will always be less than the driving pressure .  the use of air, helium and hydrogen as driving gases has been considered . experiments in a gun tunnel are reported which show that the equilibrium piston technique enables steady stagnation pressures to be achieved over a time of approximately 15 ms using air as the driving gas .  the expansion caused by the piston acceleration is shown to interact with the stationary piston, but this is found to produce only a small drop in stagnation pressure .",

        "abstract": "viscous and inviscid nonequilibrium gas flows . the condition of immediate freezing of the mass fraction of dissociated species of air at the equilibrium value behind the shock envelope prevails over a major portion of the flight spectrum associated with lifting re-entry vehicles .  this is observed by means of order-of-magnitude considerations within the limits of the present knowledge of chemical reaction rates for the constituents of air .  accordingly, investigations of the viscous and inviscid hypersonic flow about blunt and sharp leading edge slender bodies are made .  the investigations are generalized to consider an arbitrary degree of dissociation in the ambient free stream .  this condition is included in order to allow comparison with the flow field about a model in the test section of a hypersonic facility with dissociated air species present in the free stream . inviscid frozen flow investigations are made for blunt and sharp leading edge slender body power-law geometries .  the results indicate that the influence of a finite leading edge, in inducing a pressure field far downstream (/blast-wave/ analogy), is considerably diminished for this model .  this conclusion is verified numerically by a characteristics solution for the hypersonic flow about a /sonic-wedge/ slab . the viscous investigations consider the boundary-layer interaction problem with a frozen degree of dissociation .  in this case, as in the inviscid analysis, the governing parameter is observed to be the ratio of the dissociation energy to the free-stream kinetic energy .  the influence of this parameter on the boundary-layer interaction mechanism for a highly cooled, noncatalytic wall is presented . the influence of a frozen flow field on skin friction and heat transfer is also discussed . finally, since higher mach number gas flows may be generated in wind tunnel nozzles where dissociation nonequilibrium effects are present, the possibility of employing expansions with a controlled degree of dissociation as a technique for aerodynamic simulation is presented .",

(1) small temperature changes in the boundary layer along a constant- and along a variable-temperature wall, and (2) large temperature changes in the boundary layer along a constant-temperature wall . dimensionless forms of heat-transfer and friction parameters and boundary-layer thicknesses are tabulated . the results indicate that coolant emission and increased stream-to-wall temperature ratios diminished the friction and heat transfer for a constant wall temperature .  for a variable wall temperature with small temperature differences in the boundary layer, the friction was unaffected, but the heat transfer was greatly increased for increased wall-temperature gradient .  heat-transfer results in the literature reveal that transpiration cooling is much more effective for prandtl numbers of the order of 5.0 than for 0.7 .",

        "abstract": "theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamic-heating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic mach numbers . the effect of a strong, negative pressure gradient upon the local rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer on the isothermal surface of an electrically heated, cylindrical body of revolution with a hemispherical nose was determined from wind-tunnel tests at a mach number of 1.97 .  the investigation indicated that the local heat-transfer parameter, based on flow conditions just outside the boundary layer, decreased from a value of 0.65 0.10 at the stagnation point of the hemisphere to a value  of 0.43 0.05 at the junction with the cylindrical afterbody .  because measurements of the static pressure distribution over the hemisphere indicated that the local flow pattern tended to become stationary as the free-stream mach number was increased to 3.8, this distribution of heat-transfer parameter is believed representative of all mach numbers greater than 1.97 and of temperatures less than that of dissociation .  the local heat-transfer parameter was independent of reynolds number based on body diameter in the range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 . the measured distribution of heat-transfer parameter agreed within theoretical distribution calculated with foreknowledge only of the pressure distribution about the body .  this method, applicable to any body of revolution with an isothermal surface, combines the mangler transformation, stewartson transformation, and thermal solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow problem, and thus evaluates the heat-transfer rate in axisymmetric compressible flow in terms of the known heat-transfer rate in an approximately equivalent two-dimensional incompressible flow . measurements of recovery-temperature distributions at mach numbers of 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recovery factors having an average value of 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere which increased abruptly at the shoulder to an average value of 0.840 0.012 on the cylindrical afterbody .  this result suggests that the usual representation of the laminar recovery factor as the square root of the prandtl number is conservative in the presence of a strong, accelerating pressure gradient .",

        "abstract": "investigation of full scale split trailing edge wing flaps with various chords and hinge locations . an investigation was conducted in the n. a. c. a. full-scale wind tunnel on a small parasol monoplane equipped with three different split trailing-edge wing flaps .  the object of the investigation was to determine and correlate data on the characteristics of the airplane and flaps as affected by variation in flap chord, flap deflection, and flap location along the wing chord .  the chords of the flaps were 10, 20, and 30 percent of the wing chord and each flap was tested at deflections from 0 to 75 when located successively at 68, 80, and 88.8 percent of the wing chord aft of the leading edge .  the investigation included force tests, pressure-distribution tests, and downwash surveys .  the results give the lift, the drag, and the pitching-moment characteristics of the airplane, the flap forces and moments, the pressure distribution over the flaps and wing at one section, and the downwash characteristics of the flap and wing combinations . an increase in flap chord or distance of the flap from the leading edge of the wing increased the lift of the airplane but had an adverse effect on the wing pitching moment .  the ld ratio of the airplane decreased with increase in flap deflection or flap chord .  flap normal-force coefficients were primarily a function of flap deflection and were relatively independent of flap chord, hinge-axis location, and airplane attitude .  the location of the flap center of pressure in percentage of flap chord aft of the hinge axis remained practically constant irrespective of airplane attitude and of flap deflection, chord, or location .  flap hinge-moment coefficients varied with a power of flap chord greater than the square so that with regard to hinge moments narrow flaps were the most efficient in producing a given increase in lift . split trailing-edge flaps materially affected the magnitude and distribution of pressures over the entire wing profile .  at low angles of attack the predominant effect of the flaps was to increase positively the lower-surface pressures ,. at high angles of attack, to increase negatively the upper-surface pressures .  downwash surveys indicated that horizontal tail planes located above the wing chord line would be more effective than those below the chord in counteracting the increased diving moment of the airplane with flaps deflected .",

        "abstract": "motions of a short 10degree blunted cone entering a martian atmosphere at arbitrary angles of attack and arbitrary pitching rates . the dynamic behavior of two probe vehicles entering a martian atmosphere in a passive manner with arbitrary initial angles of attack and pitching rates to 12degree per second has been determined . results for an entry velocity of 21,700 feet per second and an entry angle of -40degree were obtained from machine calculated solutions of the six-degree- of-freedom rigid-body equations of motion using experimental aerodynamic characteristics for the vehicles . one of the vehicles had a flat base and was statically stable in two attitudes /nose forward and base forward/ . the other vehicle, derived from the first by adding a conical afterbody, was statically stable in only one attitude /nose forward/ . a 10-rpm vehicle spin rate, believed ample for the purpose of distributing solar and aerodynamic heating over the vehicle surface, and model atmospheres encompassing the probable extremes for the planet were also considered . it was found that while the motion of the flat-based vehicle could be oscillatory about either the nose-forward or base-forward stable trim attitudes when aerodynamic heating rates were high, the range of initial angles of attack resulting in base-forward orientation was reduced by more than a factor of 3. when initial pitch rates were increased from body having only nose-forward stability showed that oscillatory angles of attack at maximum heating-rate conditions probably would not exceed about 25degrees although angles of attack when heating rates were 50 percent of maximum could be as high as 40degree . values of these upper bound angles of attack were essentially independent of initial pitch rates for the range considered . furthermore, the envelope of maximum probable angles of attack was increased only slightly when the vehicle was given a 10-rpm spin rate . the relationship between maximum amplitudes of oscillation and heating rates through high heating portions of the trajectories was preserved when model atmospheres believed to encompass the extreme possibilities for mars were used in the calculations",

        "abstract": "near noise field of a jet engine exhaust . aircraft structures located in the near noise field of a jet engine are subjected to extremely high fluctuating pressures that may cause structural fatigue .  studies of such structures have been limited by lack of knowledge of the loadings involved . the acoustic near field produced by the exhaust of a stationary turbojet engine having a high pressure ratio was measured for a single operating condition without afterburning .  the maximum over-all sound pressure without afterburning was found to be about 42 pounds per square foot along the jet boundary in the region immediately downstream of the jet-nozzle exit . with afterburning the maximum sound pressure was increased by 50 percent .  the largest sound pressures without afterburning were obtained on a constant percentage band width basis in the frequency range from 350 to 700 cps . additional tests were made at a few points to find the effect of jet velocity on near-field sound pressures and to determine the difference in value between sound-pressure levels at rigid surfaces and corresponding free-field values .  near the jet nozzle, over-all sound pressures were found to vary as a low power (approx. unity) of the jet velocity .  over-all sound-pressure levels considerably greater than the corresponding free-field levels were recorded at the surface of a rigid plate placed along the jet boundary . the downstream locations of the maximum sound pressure at any given frequency along the jet-engine-exhaust boundary and the longitudinal turbulent-velocity maximum of the same frequency along a small cold-air jet at 1 nozzle-exit radius from the jet axis were found to be nearly the same when compared on a dimensionless basis .  also, the strouhal number of the corresponding spectra maximums was found to be nearly equal at similar distances downstream . in addition to the magnitude and frequency distribution of the acoustic pressures, it is necessary to know the cross correlation of the pressure over the surface area .  cross-correlation measurements with microphones were made for a range of jet velocities at locations along the jet and at a distance from the jet .  free-field correlations of the over-all sound pressure and of the sound pressure in frequency bands from 100 to 1000 cps were obtained both longitudinally and laterally .  in addition, correlations were obtained with microphones mounted at the surface of a rigid plate that was large compared with the distance over which a positive correlation existed . the region of positive correlation was generally found to increase with distance downstream of the engine to 6.5 nozzle-exit diameters, but remained nearly constant thereafter .  in general, little change in the correlation curves was found as a function of jet velocity or frequency-band width .  the distance from unity correlation to the first zero correlation was greater for lateral than for longitudinal correlations for the same conditions and locations .  the correlation curves obtained in free space and on the surface of the plate were generally similar . the results are interpreted in terms of pressure loads on surfaces .",

(in the ritz method, not even the convergence of the slopes can be guaranteed .)  the method yields numerical results for plates of all shapes for which the membrane problem (which we shall call the base problem) admits an explicit solution .  as an example we shall consider a clamped square plate under a uniform load . this problem has been the object of numerous investigations, some of which are theoretical, while others are purely numerical, use infinite simple and double series, and operate with an infinite number of linear equations and an infinite number of unknowns .  an inspection of the general formulae derived in the present paper, formulae which become simple in numerical applications, would show how some of the numerical methods might be rendered rigorous .  the convergence of higher derivatives is of great practical interest for the approximate computation of the stresses .",

        "abstract": "the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression . in two previous papers the authors have discussed in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of cylindrical and spherical shells .  it was shown that not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times higher than that found by experiments, but the observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different from that predicted .  furthermore, it was pointed out that the different explanations for this discrepancy advanced by l. h. donnell and w. flugge are untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these explanations are compared with the experimental facts . by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the authors were led to the belief that in general the buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory . this point of view was substantiated by model experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic support .  the non-linear characteristics of such structures cause the load necessary to keep the shell in equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave amplitude once the structure started to buckle .  thus, first of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is released once the buckling has started,. this explains the observed rapidity of the buckling process . furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations during the testing process . in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial compression .  first it is shown by an approximate calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops with increasing deflection .  then the results of this calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of the buckling process as observed in an actual testing machine .",

        "abstract": "an investigation of the flow about a plane half-wing of cropped delta planform and 6( symmetrical section at stream mach numbers between 0. 8 and 1. 41 . a study has been made of the flow development over the wing as the incidence and stream mach number vary and this is illustrated by surface pressure distributions and oil-flow patterns .  the growth and movement of the two main surface shocks (the rear and forward shocks) is discussed, and conditions for flow separation through these shocks are considered .  for the rear shock, which has little sweep, these conditions are similar to those for shock-induced separation on two-dimensional aerofoils .  the forward shock is comparatively highly swept and separation seems to correspond to two rather different but simultaneously-attained conditions, one related to the component mach number normal to the shock front and the other to the position of the reattachment line . the flow in the region between the leading edge and the forward shock is shown to have certain characteristics analogous to those found upstream of the shock on two-dimensional aerofoils .  to the rear of the forward shock, but ahead of the rear shock, the flow at low supersonic speeds resembles in some respects that about a simple cone . the general flow development is related in the text to the wing lift and pitching moment, and the drag . the first two are most affected by the aft movement of the rear shock, which also stimulates the transonic drag rise .  the lift-dependent drag is shown to be influenced by the appearance of leading-edge separation and possibly also by some stage in the development of the forward shock . the flow over the cropped-delta planform is noteworthy for the absence of the strong outboard shock and this is attributed partly to the cropped tip and partly to the unswept trailing edge .  a comparison is made with results obtained during preliminary tests in which the wing planform closely resembled that of a true delta .",

        "abstract": "some low speed problems of high speed aircraft . the first part of the paper deals with the low speed aerodynamics of aircraft shapes suggested by kuchemann, at the second international congress in aeronautical sciences at zurich in 1960, as suitable for achieving a required range at supersonic speeds, namely wingbody arrangements with sweepback angles of 55degrees or 60degrees and streamwise thickness-chord ratio of about 5 per cent suitable for low supersonic speed, and slender near-triangular wings with sharp leading edges suitable for mach numbers of about 2 or more . no attention is given to /slewed/ wings, powered lift or variable geometry . in dealing briefly with swept wings, the need for avoiding separation of flow from the leading edge is demonstrated, with the conclusion that it is desirable to use leading edge flaps with blowing or suction at the knee together with blown trailing edge flaps . wind tunnel tests are described on a simplified model with these boundary layer control methods applied . mention is made of the possibility of adverse ground effect on maximum lift . more attention is given to the case of slender wings because their use involves a new type of flow with separation from all edges . this flow and its steadiness are therefore discussed from the point of view of the possibility of buffeting,. the effect of plan form on static longitudinal stability and pitch-up is analysed,. and a short summary of available results on damping in pitch is given . large rolling moments due to sideslip are shown to give rise to serious problems of control, and the present state of knowledge of static lateral and directional stability and rolling and yawing rotary derivatives is discussed . finally the effects of proximity to the ground are summarised . the second part of the paper is concerned with work aimed at clarifying some of the requirements for handling qualities of future aircraft . it is not so much concerned with forecasts of the dynamic behaviour of these future aircraft as with determining what the pilot wants . two aspects of control in the vertical plane are discussed in some detail namely speed control and glide path holding . flight tests on an avro 707a aircraft, with artificially worsened characteristics, are described, and it is shown that substantially constant performance in the piloting task can be achieved at the expense of increased pilot effort . some tentative conclusions on desirable levels of speed stability and phugoid damping are, nevertheless, drawn . a brief review of the present status of lateral/directional handling requirements, using mainly american data, is also included .",

        "abstract": "interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes . the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes . part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface . many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore, frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information is at present available on this point . most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation . some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce . some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of the paper .",

        "abstract": "an investigation of lifting effects on the intensity of sonic booms . this paper is a brief summary of an investigation made to check the effect of lift on the shock noise of aircraft flying at supersonic speeds .  the method of hayes has been combined with the theory of whitham to predict the asymptotic shock strength of wings carrying lift and of combinations of bodies and lifting wings .  (a similar, but not quite as general, method was derived by walkden in ref. 6 .)  whitham's formula, including only the volume term, has been used extensively to predict the boom intensity of aeroplane type bodies and the agreement with experiment has, so far, been quite reasonable .  the test data obtained to date extends only up to about 40,000 ft. altitude and the calculations of this paper show that under those conditions the shock noise of the aircraft tested so far will, in most cases, be dominated by the volume term .  it is shown that at higher altitudes lifting effects will dominate for even the small fighter and they will dominate over most of the altitude range for large bomber and supersonic transport aircraft .  the boom intensity due to lift decreases with altitude as which compares to in the volume case (=pressure at altitude h) .  it is insensitive to mach number, wing loading, wing plan shape and lift distribution .  a simple rule for calculating the shock noise due to combined volume and lifting effects is proposed which is applicable to configurations with wings located towards the rear of the fuselage .  the rule states that the shock noise of an aircraft carrying lift is equal to the shock noise due to volume (neglecting lift) or the shock noise due to lift (neglecting volume), whichever is the greater .  a chart is presented from which rapid estimates can be made of the shock noise of lifting wing-body combinations .",

(1) the effect of transverse shear deformation and (2) the effect of transverse normal stress deformation .  the first of these two effects has been known to be of importance in the theory of plates and beams .  the second effect was found to occur in a manner which is typical for shells and has no counterpart in flat-plate theory . the general results of this report have been applied to the solution of problems concerning flat plates, circular rings, circular cylindrical shells, and spherical shells .  in each case numerical examples have been given, illustrating the magnitude of the effects of transverse shear and normal stress deformation . the results of this investigation indicate the necessity of taking account of transverse shear and normal stress in sandwich-type shells, as soon as there is an order-of-magnitude difference between the elastic constants of the core layer and of the face layers of the composite shell .  it was found that the changes due to transverse shear and normal stress deformation in the core may be so large as to be no mere corrections to the results of the theory without transverse core flexibility . the actual magnitude of the changes is greatly dependent on the geometry and loading condition of the structure under consideration so that no general rules may be given which indicate for which elastic modulus ratio the changes begin to be significant . solutions of problems in the present theory may in general be obtained by mathematical methods which are similar to those employed in the theory of plates and shells without the effect of transverse shear and normal stress deformation included .  the present work does not include consideration of buckling and finite deflection effects .",

        "abstract": "a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin elastic shallow spherical shells . a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at relatively small values of the deflection amplitude .  it is also one for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed .  for structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy criterion/ proposed by tsien . in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and experimentally .  in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the coefficients of equal powers .  the basic parameter for the shallow dome is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its thickness t .  for small values of this ratio the expansions converge rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load according to the classical criterion .  for higher values of h t, convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the buckling load with the number of terms which were computed .  however even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs . these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied, the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome . experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the theoretical calculation was made .  a transition to energy criterion for higher domes is also indicated .",

        "abstract": "on the vibration of thin cylindrical shells under internal pressure . the frequency spectra and vibration modes of thin-walled circular cylinders subjected to internal pressure are considered . it is shown that for very thin cylinders the internal pressure has a significant effect on the natural vibration characteristics . for these cylinders, particularly those having smaller length to diameter ratios, the mode associated with the lowest frequency is in general not the simplest mode .  the exact number of circumferential nodes, n, which occur in the mode associated with the lowest frequency, depends on the internal pressure p . if this number n is large, it decreases rapidly with increasing p when p is small, and the /fundamental/ frequency--the lowest frequency at each p--increases rapidly with increasing internal pressure .  at higher values of internal pressure the frequency spectrum tends to be arranged in the regular manner, the frequency increases with the increasing number of circumferential nodes, and the lowest frequency rises slowly with the internal pressure . experimental results on the frequency spectra, vibration modes, and structural damping of a series of thin-walled cylinders subjected to internal pressure are briefly described .  these results show agreement with the features predicted by reissner's the effect of slight deviation of the cylinder from perfect circular symmetry is discussed .",

        "abstract": "the use of models for the determination of critical flutter speeds . the use of model tests in the prediction of full-scale critical flutter speeds is now well established, and the technique of such tests is therefore worthy of discussion . in order to obtain critical speeds for the model within the speed range of ordinary wind tunnels it is necessary that the model should differ in some respect from a mere small suggested by mckinnon wood the modification of the model consists in a reduction of its effective stiffnesses . this method has the defect /in most cases probably not serious/ that the model experiment is conducted at a reynolds number much below that for full-scale . in the present paper it is pointed out that an alternative method of reducing the critical speed is to increase the mass loading of the model and to make the flutter tests in compressed air . * it is then quite feasible to reach the full-scale reynolds number . this method of reducing the critical speeds by a proportionate increase of all effective densities may also be combined with a reduction of the elasticity of the model . the relation of model and full-scale stresses at the critical flutter speeds is considered . where the reduction in critical speed is effected by increase of density only, the model and full-scale stresses are equal . in a model of reduced elasticity the stresses in the wires are the same as for full-scale,  whereas, the stresses in the spars are less than for full-scale . this is in accord with the usual experience that the wires of such a model are the first parts of the structure to fail in a flutter . lastly, the influence of gravity on flutter is considered . this is negligibly small for full-scale, but not necessarily so for the model . gravitational effects can sometimes be corrected by suitable orientation of the model .",

        "abstract": "some current and proposed investigations into the flow for slender delta and other wings in unsteady motion . the practical need for research into the aerodynamics of slender delta wings in unsteady motion has been emphasized in a recent paper by zbrozek .  two important aspects are ..  -      formation and presence of leading-edge vortices . with oscillatory or transient modes of longitudinal (or chordwise) bending . the first of the aspects above, has already been briefly discussed in ref. 2 .  one feature of the flow with leading-edge vortices which seems to be of particular significance to the dynamic behaviour of a wing is the shedding of vorticity at the leading edge as well as at the trailing edge .  any time-dependent motion, or distortion, of the wing leads to a change in the rate at which vorticity is shed .  with more conventional types of flow, the free vorticity being shed only from the trailing edge has diminishing influence on the wing, but when the free vorticity is shed from the leading edge, in passing downstream, it remains close to the upper surface of the wing .  it might be expected then, that, although the magnitudes of the unsteady forces may not be greatly affected for a slender delta, the time delays associated with the forces may be significantly different for the attached and separated regimes of leading-edge flow .",

        "abstract": "the flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonic speeds . when certain conditions are fulfilled for thickness ratio, aspect ratio, and reduced frequency for a three-dimensional wing, it can be shown that the partial differential equation for the non-steady perturbation potential can be reduced to a comparatively simple linear equation . the solution is then obtained by applying a fourier transformation in the free-stream direction and then using an iterative process developed by adams and sears for steady flow . the method gives solutions valid for low combinations of aspect ratio and reduced frequency . the method is applied to a delta wing oscillating in some selected rigid and elastic modes . from the results it can be seen that the special non-steady forces in the potential equation, which are neglected in slender-body theory, are very important . stability derivatives can also be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damping in pitch may be negative at m 1 for delta wings of too high aspect ratio .",

        "abstract": "a method of calculating the short period longitudinal stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady compressible flow . a method is developed for the calculation of the pressure distribution and the aerodynamic forces and moments on a wing performing harmonic pitching and heaving oscillations . the calculation is based on the assumption of inviscid potential flow without shock waves and is restricted to small incidence, so that the linearized theory is valid . in contrast to other work in the field the theory applies to all mach numbers .  it is restricted to small values of the reduced frequency and should be valid for the usual range of short periods occurring at present in flight .  the formal solution yields two integral equations for the parts of the load, which are in phase and go out of phase with the oscillation,. these are of the same form as the corresponding equation in steady flow . the way is thus opened for solutions over the whole mach number range at small frequencies, if the corresponding steady solutions can be found .  the calculation is in fact easiest for m = 1 and has been done here for delta-wings to supplement a previous supersonic calculation, made on different frequency assumptions, which broke down near m = 1 . it appears from the two sets of results that the short period oscillation will be unstable near m = 1, if the apex angle of the delta wing is greater than about 60 .  this confirms a now generally recognised trend . such results near m = 1 must of course be invalidated to an unknown extent by thickness viscosity and shock waves at their maximum effect .  nevertheless it is unlikely that these factors will remove the critical nature of the transonic damping as calculated by this method . with all its obvious limitations this method, when extended to other planforms, should provide a useful tool in studying the effect of geometrical parameters on the stability of an aircraft at transonic speeds .",

        "abstract": "a new theory for the buckling of thin cylinders under axial compression and bending . the results of experiments on axial loading of cylindrical shells (thin enough to buckle below the elastic limit and too short to buckle as euler columns) are not in good agreement with previous theories, which have been based on the assumptions of perfect initial shape and infinitesimal deflections .  experimental failure stresses range from 0.6 to 0.15 of the theoretical .  the discrepancy is apparently considerably greater for brass and mild-steel specimens than for duralumin and increases with the radius- thickness ratio .  there is an equally great discrepancy between observed and predicted shapes of buckling deflections . in this paper an approximate large-deflection theory is developed, which permits initial eccentricities or deviations from cylindrical shape to be considered .  true instability is, of course, impossible under such conditions,. the stress distribution is no longer uniform, and it is assumed that final failure takes place when the maximum stress reaches the yield point .  the effect of initial eccentricities and of large deflections is much greater than for the case of simple struts .  measurements of initial eccentricities in actual cylinders have not been made,. however, it is shown that most of these discrepancies can be explained if the initial deviations from cylindrical form are assumed to be resolved into a double harmonic series, and if certain reasonable assumptions are made as to the magnitudes of these components of the deviations .  with these assumptions the failing stress is found to be a function of the yield point as well as of the modulus of elasticity and the radius-thickness ratio .  on the basis of this a tentative design formula (5) is proposel, which involves relations suggested by the theory but is based on experimental data . it is shown that similar discrepancies between experiments and previous theories on the buckling of thin cylinders in pure bending can be reasonably explained on the same basis, and that the maximum bending stress can be taken as about 1.4 times the values given by equation buckling problems can probably be explained by similar considerations, and it is hoped that this discussion may help to open a new field in the study of buckling problems . the large-deflection theory developed in the paper should be useful in exploring this field, and may be used in other applications as well . the paper presents the results of about a hundred new tests of thin cylinders in axial compression and bending, which, together with numerous tests by lundquist, form the experimental evidence for the conclusions arrived at .",

        "abstract": "contributions to the theory of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer . an approximation to the heat transfer rate across a laminar incompressible boundary layer, for arbitrary distribution of main stream velocity and of wall temperature, is obtained by using the energy equation in von mises's form, and approximating the coefficients in a manner which is most closely correct near the surface .  the heat transfer rate to a portion of surface of length l breadth is given as where k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, o its prandtl number, p its density, u its viscosity, r(x) is the skin friction, and t(x) the excess of wall temperature over main stream temperature . a critical appraisement of the formula indicates that it should be very accurate for large, but that for of order 0.7 (for most gases) the constant should be replaced by 0.73, when the error should not exceed this yields a formula for nusselt number in terms of the reynolds number r and the mean square root of the skin friction coefficient c, in the case of uniform wall temperature . however, for the boundary layer with uniform main stream, the original formula is accurate to within 3 percent even for .  by known transformations an expression is deducted for heat transfer to a surface, with arbitrary temperature distribution along it, and with a uniform stream outside it at arbitrary mach number (equation (42)) .  from this the temperature distribution along such a surface is deduced in the case (of importance at high mach numbers) when heat transfer to it is balanced entirely by radiation from it .  this calculation, which includes the solution of a non-linear integral equation, gives higher temperatures near the nose, and lower ones farther back (figure 2), than are found from a theory which assumes the wall temperature uniform and averages the heat transfer balance .  this effect will be considerably mitigated for bodies of high thermal conductivity., the author is not in a position to say whether or not it will be appreciable for metal projectiles .  but for stony meteorites at a certain stage of their flight through the atmosphere it indicates that melting at the nose and re-solidification farther back may occur, for which the shape and constitution of a few of them affords evidence . an appendix shows how the method for approximating and solving von mises's equation could be used to determine the skin friction as well as heat transfer rate, but this line seems to have no advantage over established approximate methods .",

        "abstract": "turbulent diffusion in the wake of a blunt nosed body at hypersonic speeds . at reynolds numbers greater than about 5 x 10 corresponding to altitudes below about 180,000 ft, the hot outer inviscid wake behind the bow shock wave produced by a blunt-nosed body at hypersonic speeds is cooled mainly by turbulent diffusion and conduction .  turbulence originates in the inner wake formed by the coalescence of the free shear layers (or annulus) shed from the body surface when the boundary layer separates from the surface .  as this turbulence spreads outward, it swallows enthalpy or momentum defect originally contained in the outer inviscid wake .  if the turbulence is locally similar--i.e., if it behaves at each station like a slice of a low-speed /self-similar/ wake--then the turbulent diffusivity grows from a low initial value near the body to a value corresponding to the total drag of the body at about 300 body diameters downstream .  at flight velocities of the order of 9,000-10,000 ft per sec. the growth of the turbulent inner wake predicted on the basis of locally similar turbulence is in good agreement with shadowgraph measurements of wake widths behind spheres obtained in ballistic ranges in the region from 200 to 4,000 body diameters downstream of the body . tentatively, one concludes that the turbulence mechanism in the wake with respect to a fixed observer is similar to the low-speed case, in spite of the large mean temperature gradients . in order to illustrate the behavior of an observable such as electron density in a turbulent wake behind a blunt body, the two limiting cases of thermodynamic equilibrium and pure diffusion (zero electron-ion recombination rate) are calculated for m = 22 at altitudes of 100,000 and 200,000 ft .  even for the case of thermodynamic equilibrium, the predicted turbulent radar trail length is about 200 body diameters at l-band (1,300 mc) at 100,000-ft altitude and about 150 body diameters for uhf (400 mc) at 200,000 ft .  one interesting result is that the width of the plasma cylinder corresponding to the plasma requency at l-band remains virtually constant at about 3.5 body diameters in the range 30 150 at 100,000-ft altitude . these results are sufficiently encouraging that one can consider including the effects of finite chemical and electron-ion recombination rates in the analysis in order to give a more complete picture of the wake at hypersonic speeds .",

(wind-on frequency determination was accurate only to approximately 1 percent .)",

        "abstract": "ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone . the analytic investigation of laminar combustion processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional present some mathematical difficulties .  there are, however, several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in comparison with that in the principal direction of flow . such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate, combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc .  in these cases the problem may be simplified by employing what is known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate .  physically it consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is small, the variations of flow properties along the direction of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direction normal to the main flow .  the analytic description of the problem simplifies accordingly .  the present analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas streams .  one stream consists of a cool combustible mixture, the second is hot combustion products .  the two streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical reaction .  the decomposition of the combustible stream is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law . for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature distribution, the questions to be answered are ..  (1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development .  since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream .  however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension .  the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .",

        "abstract": "aerodynamic heating of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 . results are presented from recent investigations of the aerodynamic heating rates of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 . data obtained in flight and wind-tunnel tests have shown that the flat-faced cylinder has about 50 percent the stagnation-point heating rates of the hemisphere over nearly the entire mach number range . tests made at a mach number of 2 on a series of bodies made up of hemispherical segments of varying radius of curvature showed that slight amounts of curvature can decrease the local rates at the edge of the flat-faced cylinders with only a slight increase in the stagnation rate . the total heat transfer to such slightly curved bodies is also somewhat smaller than the total heat transfer to flat-faced cylinders . comparison of several tests with theoretical heating-rate distributions showed that both laminar and turbulent local rates can be predicted by available theories /given the pressure distribution about the body/ reasonably well, although the scatter of the available data still leaves open the choice between the theories at the edge of the bodies, where they usually differ . tests on a flat-faced cylinder at a mach number of 2.49 and at angles of attack up to 15degree showed the movement of the apparent stagnation point from the center of the body to the 50 percent windward station at creased about 30 percent while that near the leeward edge decreased about 20 percent at 15degree angle of attack . preliminary results on a concave nose have indicated the possibility that this type of design may be developed to give heating rates significantly lower than even the flat-faced cylinder rates . the test results have also shown, however, the existence of an unsteady flow phenomenon which can increase the heating rates to extremely high values .",

        "abstract": "on supersonic flow past a slightly yawing cone . this paper is concerned with the motion of a circular cone, of not too blunt an angle, through air at high speed .  if the direction of motion of the cone coincides with its axis of symmetry, the resulting air flow is well known . here we consider the perturbation produced by a small /yaw/--i.e., the case in which the cone is moving not quite in the direction of its axis .  the results are confirmed experimentally, and have applications to ballistics, though we are not concerned with the latter here,. they may also be useful as providing a check on various approximate methods of wider applicability .  the square of the yaw is neglected--an approximation of which the validity is discussed .  (similar methods can be applied to the second-order effects of the yaw, which are also of ballistic significance,. but the computations have not yet been completed .)  it should be observed that, because of the lack of symmetry, the flow will be neither irrotational nor isentropic .",

(a) even with initial imperfections the incremental theory of plasticity considerably overestimates the buckling strength as compared with the deformation theory, which is in substantially good agreement with experiments, and strength of cylindrical shells subject to axial compression are significant . it is the purpose of this note to discuss the second conclusion in terms of lee's experimental and theoretical results, other experimental data on inelastic buckling of 7075-t6 aluminum-alloy cylinders, and recent theoretical results on the inelastic buckling of cylinders in the axisymmetric and circumferential modes .  in particular, this writer does not believe that lee has proved that initial imperfections are important for the group of cylinders that he has tested .  on the contrary, it is believed that initial imperfections are completely insignificant for this group of cylinders although of probable significance in other cases .",

        "abstract": "torispherical shells - a caution to designers . it has recently become apparent, through a rigorous stress analysis of a specific case that designing torispherical shells by the current edition of the asme code on unfired pressure vessels can lead to failure during proof-testing of the vessel .  the purpose of the present paper is to show in what respects the code fails to give accurate results . as an illustrative example, a hypothetical pressure vessel with a torispherical head having a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was selected .  the supports of the vessel were considered to be either on the main cylinder or around the torus .  the vessel was subjected to internal pressure and the elastic stresses in it were determined rigorously and by the code .  a comparison of the two revealed that the code predicted stresses in the head which were less than one half of those actually occurring .  furthermore, the code gave no indication of the presence of high compressive circumferential direct stresses which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically the entire torus .  if the head had been fabricated using a steel with a yield point of would have failed or undergone large deformations, whereas the code would have predicted that it was safe .  the code's rules for torispherical heads are thus in need of revision for certain geometries .  the implications of the foregoing results are currently being studied by the asme,. in the interim, however, designers should exercise care in applying the code to torispherical shells . it is also shown in the paper that the use of the membrane state as a particular solution of the differential equations is not a good approximation for toroidal shells of the type considered .",

        "abstract": "on the theory of thin elastic toroidal shells . the author obtains asymptotic solutions to the problem of rotationally symmetric small deflection of thin toroidal elastic shells .  he first reduces the problem to that of integrating a single linear nonhomogeneous ordinary differential equation involving two parameters .  asymptotic formulae for the complementary function are obtained by applying the general method of langer (trans.amer.math.soc.33, advantage of yielding results valid near the points where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution, where the methods of asymptotic integration customary in shell theory fail (see the preceding review) .  for two problems in which only the complementary function is required, the author's results are compared with those obtained by wissler (dissertation, zurich, 1916) by a method of power series expansion,. the agreement is within 4 or better .  the author observes that the usual method of obtaining asymptotic expressions for a particular integral, being based on using as an approximation the complementary function obtained from the membrane theory, will fail near points where the tangent plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution .  he therefore introduces a new method, which he states was developed jointly with e. reissner .  he applies his results to the cases of an joint loaded symmetrically and parallel to its axis, a corrugated pipe subject to axial load, and a corrugated cylinder subject to axial pressure . many numerical calculations are involved and there are two tables of functions occuring in the solutions .",

        "abstract": "slipstream flow around several tilt-wing vtol aircraft models operating near the ground . a collection of data from a number of brief investigations made with three different models to determine the character of the slipstream flow along the ground is presented for multiple-propeller tilt-wing vtol aircraft configurations operating near the ground .  in general, the tests involved tuft surveys and slipstream dynamic-pressure measurements for several tilt-wing vtol models .  a more extensive series of tests, including some measurements of the erosion of gravel by the slipstream and some measurements of the unsteady rolling, yawing, and pitching moments, was also made on one of the models operating in the hovering condition near the ground . the results of the flow studies indicated the presence of a stronger and deeper slipstream flow along the center line of the aircraft, and to some extent along parallel planes between adjacent propellers (on one wing), than to the side of the aircraft .  this effect is caused by an intensification of the individual slipstreams as they meet at the planes of flow symmetry .  the intensified flow along the center line of the aircraft is amplified by the presence of the fuselage and causes the dynamic pressure to be greater in front of the aircraft than would be expected on the basis of the slipstream of the individual propellers . in the erosion tests it was found that gravel, if sufficiently small, was rapidly eroded by the slipstream and that this gravel could be thrown high into the air if it struck even very small fixed obstacles on the ground (obstacles with a height less than the diameter of the gravel) .  results of the investigation of moment fluctuations indicated that there are large, erratic variations of rolling, yawing, and pitching moments and that the propellers, reacting to an erratic inflow from the recirculating slipstream, are the primary source of these moments .",

        "abstract": "heat transfer to bodies traveling at high speed in the upper atmosphere . a general method has been developed, using the methods of kinetic theory, whereby the surface temperatures of bodies can be calculated for steady flight at any speed in a rarefied gas .  the particular solution was made for a flat plate., however, the calculations can be easily extended to bodies of arbitrary shape . it was found that the aerodynamic heating problem in the absence of solar radiation, that is, for the case of nocturnal flight, becomes of negligible importance at altitudes of 125 miles and higher and up to steady flight speeds of 36,000 feet per second .  the effect of solar radiation, for the case of daytime flight, becomes increasingly important as the flight altitude is increased .  at an altitude of 150 miles and higher, solar radiation is the predominating factor that determines skin temperature .  owing to the strong effect of solar radiation on skin temperatures at high altitudes, the desirability of nocturnal flight is indicated in order to minimize skin temperatures . in order to maintain low skin temperatures, it was found that the angle of inclination of the body with respect to the flight path should be kept as small as possible .  this may be accomplished in practice by designing the body to be finely tapered and by flying the body at small angles of attack . it is pointed out that skin temperatures may be reduced by insuring thermal contact between portions of the skin inclined at positive and negative angles with respect to the flight path .  as much surface as possible should be inclined at negative angles .  practically, this may be accomplished by boattailing the body . in the event that an internal skin-cooling system is employed, it is shown that the rate of internal cooling must be of the same order of magnitude or greater than the rate at which heat is lost naturally by emitted radiation .  if the cooling rate is below the natural radiation rate, cooling has little effect upon skin temperatures . it is shown that, in the case of a missile designed to fly over a wide range of altitudes and speeds, it is desirable to make the emissivity of the skin as high as possible .  this conclusion, however, is based upon a skin surface for which the emissivity is independent of the wave length of the emitted and absorbed radiant energy . a possible method of reducing surface temperatures is indicated by the decrease in skin temperature which accompanies a decrease in thermal accommodation coefficient .  this phenomenon may be used to advantage if it is possible to decrease the accommodation coefficient by altering the surface characteristics of the skin .",

        "abstract": "hypersonic shock tunnel . a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed for obtaining fluid mechanic information at the high mach numbers and corresponding stagnation temperatures encountered in flight by long range ballistic vehicles and satellites . this report describes the hypersonic shock tunnel and presents some of the results obtained in the driven tube and in the nozzle helium is ignited in the driver to produce strong shock waves in air . a shock velocity in air as high as 55,000 fps with a calculated equilibrium temperature of 16,000 k has been produced in the driven tube . the effects of high stagnation temperatures upon the detached shock wave and the pressure distribution for blunt bodies have been observed in the nozzle test section . the detachment distance devreased greatly at high temperatures . the pressure distribution for the hemisphere was found to be less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory . shock wave boundary layer interaction at the leading edge of a flat plate was observed, and the results agreed with the analytical prediction . a detached shock wave was observed for a blunt two-dimensional body at very low densities in the test section with a flow mach number of 19.6 .",

(b) for the integral method the coordinate along the boundary of each strip is shifted so as to control perturbations of the velocity component that determines the critical point . the approach is justified by a study of the equations governing the direct method, and by consideration of model transonic flow problems for which closed form solutions are available .  the range of validity of the proposed procedure is assessed by practical application and comparison with experiment,. results are presented for a disk set normal to a low-termperature air stream at m = 4.76, and for a highly asymmetric two-dimensional configuration at m = 8 .",

        "abstract": "a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer over a curved surface . the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account for surface curvature effects on the two-dimensional boundary-layer flow which approaches a potential flow at free stream . the problem of two-dimensional viscous flow is first formulated by using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the generalized coordinates .  a boundary-layer approximation is applied to the navier-stokes equations and the gauss equation in the generalized coordinates to yield the boundary-layer equations .  the conditions under which similar solutions of the boundary-layer equations exist are determined .  by a simple transformation, the governing differential equation can be expressed in a form which reduces to the falkner-skan equation for zero surface curvature . numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to a flow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradient have been obtained .  the velocity profiles in the boundary layer and the wall skin-friction distribution for concave and convex surfaces are presented .  the wall skin friction for a convex wall is found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate .  on the other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will drop below the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to reach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase again .  the same flow problem was treated by murphy by a different method of analysis .  comparison of murphy's results with those obtained by the present method reveals some basic differences in the boundary-layer characteristics .  in particular, murphy's results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convex surface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wall it is higher .",

        "abstract": "on the aerodynamic noise of a turbulent jet . a new model is advanced for analyzing the broad-spectrum noise of a turbulent jet .  the shear layer bounding the turbulent jet is assumed to play an important role in modifying the / quadrupole sound radiation/ from the interior .  to the sound- emitting small-scale turbulent eddies (with frequencies much higher than those of large-scale eddies), the laminar shear layer has an irregular contour, as if the large-scale turbulent motions were frozen .  the linearized analysis is then applied to the laminar shear layer to relate the acoustic oscillations across it . the concept of geometrical acoustics is generalized to represent the passage of an acoustic ray through a laminar shear layer . acoustic rays may be traced across the shear layer as transmission and refraction, but they may also be apparently /absorbed/ or /generated/ by the laminar layer .  this /generation/ is visualized as the schematic representation, within the framework of geometrical acoustics, of the action of the reynolds stress in transferring energy from the shearing mean flow to the acoustic waves .  such action of the reynolds stress can be neglected in ordinary acoustics when the acoustic medium is not moving at speeds comparable to the speed of sound in the medium . however, this action is of crucial importance in the aerodynamic noise of high-speed turbulent jets where the reynolds stress is the fundamental element of the radiating quadrupoles, according to lighthill . those acoustic waves that become /stationary/ with respect to the local mean flow somewhere in the interior of the shear layer are significantly modified by the viscous action through the critical layer .  the shear layer therefore serves as a selective amplifier of the acoustic waves passing through it . kinematically, the shear layer brings about the preferred downstream emission ..  dynamically, the shear-layer augmentation significantly increases the polar peak noise level .  the acoustic power output per unit solid angle for such downstream emissions augmented by the shear layer (including the polar peak) varies as, predicted by lighthill, but without lighthill's convective corrections .  on the other hand, the acoustic power output per unit solid angle nearly normal to the jet, due to the transmitted downstream-propagating waves, varies roughly as .  heating the jet gas increases the shear-layer augmentation and may increase the polar peak noise level by several db .  the silencing action of the edge notches and edge teeth may also be interpreted as due apparently to the result of possible distortion of the shear-layer profiles .",

        "abstract": "an analytic extension of the shock-expansion method . the problem is considered of calculating approximately the inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a smooth two-dimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream .  the assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic shock-expansion method with straight characteristics .  an elementary characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple shock-expansion method should be satisfactory for computing the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances it may be expected to break down .  by utilizing characteristic variables the isentropic shock-expansion method is then formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock shape corresponding to this zero-order approximation .  in the special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is, for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shock-shape expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender bodies in turn reduces to the simple-wave result first given by friedrichs . employing the analytic form of the isentropic shock-expansion method as a zero-order approximation, an analytically consistent perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an oblique shock .  the scheme by its nature helps to define those regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected in simple shock-expansion theory, namely, the curvature and reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary conditions at the shock wave .  analytic solutions are obtained for the first-order corrections, including the surface pressure distribution .  the necessary numerical computation of the integrals involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the method of characteristics .  to illustrate the method and its accuracy, the zero-order shock shape and first-order pressure distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at an infinite free-stream mach number .  these results are compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available, and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement .",

        "abstract": "on the approach to chemical and vibrational equilibrium behind a strong normal shock wave . the concurrent approach to chemical and vibrational equilibrium of a pure diatomic gas passing through a strong normal shock wave is investigated .  it is demonstrated that the equilibrium degree of dissociation behind the shock front, and hence the density, for the case where the vibrational degrees of freedom are frozen out can exceed the degree of dissociation, and hence the density, for the case where all degrees of freedom are in equilibrium .  thus the necessary condition for a maximum of the density between the shock front and the position of full equilibrium flow downstream of the shock front is established .  the sufficient condition that such a maximum be observable is shown to be that the approach to equilibrium of the vibrational degrees of freedom (or any other internal degrees of freedom) must lag the approach to dissociation equilibrium by a significant amount,. that is, there must be at least an order of magnitude difference in the respective relaxation times before such a maximum might be observed .  an example calculation for a mach 13 strong shock wave in oxygen illustrates the appearance of such a maximum of the density and its dependency upon the relative values of the vibration and dissociation relaxation times .",

        "abstract": "on the thrust hypothesis for the jet flap including jet-mixing effects . this paper is concerned with the thrust generated by a jet flap .  it is shown that a /linear/ thrust hypothesis can be obtained, provided linearized potential flow is assumed .  in fact, the linearized problem of a jet-flap system is found to be the linear combination of a lift problem and a thrust problem .  the lift problem gives all the lift generated, but it is of interest to note that the thrust problem would yield all the thrust developed by the jet flap within the limitation of the linearized theory . the mixing of the jet flap with the surrounding fluid is analyzed by the momentum-integral method .  the analysis substantiates stratford's suggestion for obtaining an increase of thrust by causing the jet to mix with the main stream in a region of high suction .  finally, some approximate formulas, relating the thrust and the jet angle, are derived .  the drag of the airfoil section and other viscous effects are, however, not considered .",

        "abstract": "stable combustion of a high-velocity gas in a heated boundary layer . it is generally recognized that stable combustion processes in heated boundary layers may be achieved by either of two conceptual mechanisms .  in one mechanism it is pictured that the heat transfer to the wall quenches the propagating flame at a certain distance from the surface .  the equality between the flow velocity and the normal burning velocity at this quenching distance determines the position of the propagating flame .  in the second mechanism it is conceived that the hot surface provides a continuous source of ignition in much the same manner that the hot recirculation zone of a bluff body flame holder provides continuous ignition to the gas flowing around it .  in this case it is the characteristic time during which the gas must be heated that determines the position of the flame . all experimental work reported to date has been concerned with conditions where the first picture has apparently been applicable . in the present paper, experiment and analysis are given that show under what conditions the continuous ignition mechanism provides the appropriate model and also how the two models are related . to differentiate the two mechanisms an experiment was set up to study flame stabilization in high-velocity boundary layers over a wall heated in the form of a step function .  with a turbulent boundary layer and a wall temperature above 1,700f., the characteristic time was found to be a systematic and reproducible variable .  these observations led to the conclusion that a continuous ignition mechanism governs stabilization in heated turbulent boundary layers .  a rational explanation is made for the transition from the low-speed mechanism known to be applicable in unheated turbulent boundary layers and heated laminar boundary layers to the ignition mechanism applicable in heated turbulent boundary layers . as a further verification of the continuous ignition mechanism an apparent ignition energy was found .  the logarithm of the heat added at the lower stability limit was found to be a linear function of the reciprocal of the limiting wall temperature .  the activation energy derived from this arrhenius type of relation agreed reasonably well with the estimated value for the fuel used .",

        "abstract": "some effects of bluntness on boundary layer transition and heat transfer at supersonic speeds . large downstream movements of transition observed when the leading edge of a hollow cylinder or a flat plate is slightly blunted are explained in terms of the reduction in reynolds number at the outer edge of the boundary layer due to the detached shock wave .  the magnitude of this reduction is computed for cones and wedges for mach numbers to 20 . concurrent changes in outer-edge mach number and temperature occur in the direction that would increase the stability of the laminar boundary layer . the hypothesis is made that transition reynolds number is substantially unchanged when a sharp leading edge or tip is blunted .  this hypothesis leads to the conclusion that the downstream movement of transition is inversely proportional to the ratio of surface reynolds number with blunted tip or leading edge to surface reynolds number with sharp tip or leading edge .  this conclusion is in good agreement with the hollow-cylinder result at mach 3.1 . application of this hypothesis to other mach numbers yields the result that blunting the tip of a slender cone or the leading edge of a thin wedge should produce downstream movements of transition by factors ranging from 2 at mach 3.0 to 30 at mach the possible reduction in over-all heat-transfer rate and friction drag for aircraft flying at high supersonic speeds . mach number profiles near the surfaces of blunted cones and wedges are computed for an assumed shape of the detached shock wave at flight mach numbers to 20 .  the dissipation and stability of these profiles are discussed, and a method is described for estimating the amount of blunting required to produce the maximum possible downstream movement of transition .",

        "abstract": "on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel . the performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock technique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and high-temperature real-gas effects . particular attention is given to disturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for that the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak enough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach number, m /e.g., 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to remain constant to 10 per cent/ . within this range, running times much longer than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are predicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the expansion wave originating at the diaphragm . outside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the contact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel . at first sight it appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation are confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a heated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for further analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the multiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach number . thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected disturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number . experiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to provide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory . if allowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact surface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and transmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave reflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised substantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow duration may result . a striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of the tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock . this is attributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its interaction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube . further research is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the effects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of the tube . the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion wave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed . it is shown that the arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a severe limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock mach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow duration at high shock mach number . unless means can be devised to suppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to have alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over a range of shock mach number . it is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock mach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach number of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using reflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air . because of the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and the deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present investigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character . further research is required to check and extend the findings, and topics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper .",

        "abstract": "the calculation of aerodynamic loading on surfaces of any shape . the object of the report is to establish a routine method for the calculation of aerodynamic loads on wings of arbitrary shape . the method developed is based on potential theory and uses a general mathematical formula for continuous loading on a wing which is equivalent to a double fourier series with unknown coefficients . in order to evaluate the unknown coefficients the continuous loading is split up into a regular pattern of horseshoe vortices, the strengths of which are proportional to the unknown coefficients and to standard factors which are given in a table . the total downwash at chosen pivotal points is obtained by summing the downwashes due to the individual vortices, a process which is simplified by the use of specially prepared tables of the properties of the horseshoe vortex . by equating the downwash to the slope of the wing at each pivotal point, simultaneous equations are obtained, the solution of which defines the unknown coefficients . the first layout involves a total of 76 vortices over the wing, and a second layout, involving a total of 84, is shown to be of superior accuracy . the effect on the solution of the number of pivotal points is investigated and it is concluded that by a suitable choice, it is unnecessary to use a large number . results for a rectangular wing at with those obtained by other workers and it appears that there may be errors in published results in at least one of these cases . immediate development includes the application to the calculation of the characteristics of actual sweptback wings, including rotary derivatives, and future development includes also applications in wind tunnel design and technique .",

        "abstract": "secondary flow fields embedded in hypersonic shock layers . when a ramp or other compression surface is located in a locally supersonic region behind a hypersonic bow shock wave, it generates a secondary shock wave .  the ramp flow disturbance may be viewed as an embedded newtonian impact flow if the embedded shock layer is thin . examination of the applicability of newtonian flow theory to cones and wedges in uniform streams suggests that this theory can be expected to give a useful approximation to the surface pressures . a pressure equation based on this concept predicts a number of interesting things ..  first, pressures can differ from simple newtonian theory by factors of 1 5 to 3,. for example, on flare stabilizers on blunt-nosed bodies of revolution, pressures are lower than newtonian and diminish with increasing flight speed in the hypersonic speed range .  the calculated pressures vary over the flare surface as a result of the nonuniformity of its incident stream, and depend on the axial location of the flare .  in the case of a flap mounted on a large-angled blunt-nosed cone, the pressure coefficients vary from 1 to 5 through the variable entropy layer .  a pressure coefficient of 5 greater than the maximum possible in newtonian flow can occur because the compression process is more efficient than a single shock wave process .  on areas of the flap that protrude through the main bow wave, the pressure coefficient should revert to the simple newtonian value . equations are developed for the initial slopes of the normal-force and pitching-moment curves of a flare stabilizer .  in the simplest case these differ from conventional newtonian theory by the ratio of local dynamic pressure to free-stream dynamic pressure .  this ratio takes values as low as 0.1 in some of the examples considered .",

        "abstract": "an approximate solution for the axisymmetric jet of a laminar compressible fluid . an extension of the modified-oseen method of carrier, based on the linearization of the viscous term of the von mises transformation, is presented .  the method is employed to determine the velocity field associated with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow of a compressible gas with an arbitrary but constant external flow .  the approximate solution is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numerical calculation of pai . in many boundary layer problems it is not possible to make the assumption of flow similarity .  the solution in these cases can be obtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by resort to approximate solutions .  carrier and lewis (1), and more recently carrier (2), have suggested a method of obtaining approximate solutions to problems involving convection and diffusion .  this method, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an essential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of reasonable profiles .  it is well known that the integral method gives accurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely the true profiles .  according to the modified-oseen method the convective operator in the original partial differential equation is replaced by a linear one .  the resulting equation for the boundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be treated by well-known techniques . it is the purpose of this paper to indicate a modification of this procedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the axisymmetric laminar flow of a compressible gas with arbitrary but constant external flow .  the modification is based on the use of the von mises transformation with a subsequent linearization of the viscous term, rather than the linearization of the convective term . pai's problem (3), originally treated by a finite difference technique, is considered to illustrate the effectiveness of this method .",

        "abstract": "the problem of obtaining high lift-drag ratios at supersonic speeds . the importance of the lift to drag ratio is well known to all aircraft designers since it gives, to a great extent, the aerodynamic efficiency of the airplane . aerodynamic efficiency, however, is only one component of the grand compromise that a completed airplane represents .  at subsonic speeds, lift-drag ratios of well over 200 have been measured in wind tunnels on airfoil sections., but few powered aircraft have attained (lift to drag ratio) value of 20 .  it is invariably true that the requirements of stability and control, structure, and flight operation all contribute to reducing the design (lift to drag ratio) considerably below those exotic values which can be predicted from unrestricted aerodynamic theory .  if, however, a certain range or operating efficiency is required, there is most certainly a minimum if we examine the range equation we see that range is proportional to the lift-drag ratio, the thermopropulsive efficiency, and the logarithm of the initial to final weight ratio .  the appearance of the lift-drag ratio as a linear factor in the range equation indicates that every attempt should be made to increase (lift to drag ratio)., however, the search for higher (lift to drag ratio) may lead to strange and unorthodox configurations .  most frequently, such configurations are ruled out by the adverse effects of their geometry on the weight ratios .  in the present paper, we will deal with the maximum lift-drag ratio problem for conventional configurations having a wing and a body in close proximity to each other .  no attempt will be made to select a particular configuration as being the best .  however, the promising direction to go from the aerodynamic view will be stressed with the understanding that the other factors may outweight the aerodynamics .",

        "abstract": "heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of a body of revolution . in order to determine the temperature distribution over a body moving through the atmosphere, a knowledge of the local heat-transfer coefficients is required .  for slender sharp-nosed bodies, the heat-transfer coefficients are frequently approximated by using the comparable flat-plate values . however, for blunt-nosed bodies, flat-plate solutions are not applicable near the forward stagnation point .  since the greatest rate of heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, its value should be investigated .  in this note a theoretical solution is given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of a body of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, low-speed flow .  the comparable solution for two-dimensional flow has been given by squire .  in the case of a blunt-nosed body moving with supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion of the bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible that a low-speed solution, using as /free-stream/ conditions those behind the center of the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point .",
